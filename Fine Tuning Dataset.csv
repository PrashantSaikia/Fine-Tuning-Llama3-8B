Outcome
Summarize the outcome.","""Given the budget variance and projected costs, how will the new forecasted budget for the upcoming years impact the current spending?""","The new forecasted budget for the upcoming years will increase the current spending due to the budget variance and projected costs. The budget variance is the difference between the actual spend to date and the budget allocated, which is currently negative. The projected costs are also higher than the budget allocated, further increasing the spending. The new forecasted budget attempts to account for these increases, but it is unclear by how much without referring to the linked projection costs spreadsheet. It is also unclear whether this request can be managed within the remaining budget. Therefore, the impact on current spending is likely to be significant, but the exact amount cannot be determined without additional information."

Here are the KPIs and their significance:

        1. **Project Status**: This KPI indicates the current state of each project, such as 'On Track', 'At Risk', or 'Off Track'. It helps stakeholders quickly understand the overall health of the project portfolio.

        2. **Start and End Dates**: The start and end dates for each project are visualized, providing a clear timeline for project delivery. Any delays or changes to these dates can be easily identified and addressed.

        3. **Progress Bars**: Progress bars show the completion status of each project. They reveal the percentage of work completed and the amount of work remaining, helping stakeholders assess the project's progress.

        4. **Planned vs. Actual**: This KPI compares the planned timeline with the actual progress of each project. Any discrepancies can indicate potential issues or delays, prompting further investigation.

        5. **Resource Allocation**: The dashboard may also visualize how resources are allocated across projects. This can help stakeholders identify any imbalances or bottlenecks and make necessary adjustments.

        6. **Risks and Issues**: The dashboard might include a section for visualizing risks and issues associated with each project. This can help stakeholders anticipate and mitigate potential problems.

        7. **Budget vs. Spend**: This KPI compares the planned budget with the actual spending for each project. It can reveal any cost overruns or underspends, helping stakeholders manage project finances effectively.

        These KPIs, when viewed together in the Portfolio Roadmap dashboard, provide a comprehensive view of the project's progress, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and take timely actions."

"Our 2023 objectives contained some incredibly ambitious stretch goals. We were able to deliver most of the core objectives, largely down to our collective hard work, but also down to the quarterly planning and review rhythm and structure that we’re now operating within.
Let’s take a look at the 2023 objectives:
Objective 1 - Execute the Cardano Transition
Focus our ongoing work under four key goals:
Consent
- hold and win the vote to ratify the era of Voltaire Governance.
Consistency
- to build an independent development engine capable of ensuring the same high levels of performance.
Clarity
- ensuring at all time throughout the transition that the whole Cardano community understands where we are going and how they contribute.
Decentralization
- achieve a new level of decentralization, making Cardano the most decentralized blockchain according to the EDI Index.

"Launch Current Portfolio Into Ventures
In 2024, we will continue to launch the current portfolio (Portfolio Zero) into fully fledged ventures through a gated and supported spinout process. As a venture moves through each of these phases, they develop in each of the areas seen below.
As companies move from left to right, our commercial horizon will change. Firstly, some of the ideas we may have thought were the best ideas in the entire world, turn out not to be, so we shut them down. On the other hand, we might realize some initiatives are very similar to others, so we merge them together.
Sometimes it’s not about making money - it’s about securing or protecting something. Or, if it's a core piece of infrastructure we’ll open source it.
Other times, we make linear progress. When an idea is ‘fully realized’ and it’s self-sustaining, we've left behind an institution unto itself.
Every now and then, something will move back from right to left if we discover new information, or we realize that our business hypothesis isn't true.
It's a dynamic, creative, and flowing process, but it creates a lot of value as you start moving towards step 5. There's a huge multiple of value creation because you have real customers, real commercial models, liquidity, external investors, and a really good product market fit.
We’ll always be thinking about our portfolio alignment. These aren't just independent siloed ideas - they're part of a larger web, and if we get our web just right, we make money for each other.
Attract Investment
We’re in a privileged position where we can be particular on who we invest with; and we’re prioritizing smart capital from strategic investors from different sources to diversify participation.
We’ve invested in additional talent to support this objective, who will focus on expanding our investment network and raise awareness of our portfolio companies through strategic marketing intelligence. They’ll ensure we align our investment pitches with the new IOG corporate strategy.
Pilot Venture Governance and Servicing Approach
As ventures make their way through the process, we’ll always be learning, improving, and refining things. This will be the foundation to inform the design for our venture studio with a web3 focus. The definition of our long term relationships with web3-launched-ventures will be central to this sub objective, as well as taking an integrated approach to portfolio management.",How does the gated and supported spinout process for launching the current portfolio into fully fledged ventures contribute to the creation of value and alignment of the portfolio companies as a larger web?,"The gated and supported spinout process for launching the current portfolio into fully fledged ventures contributes to the creation of value and alignment of the portfolio companies as a larger web by providing a dynamic, creative, and flowing process that moves companies from left to right, starting with initial ideas and progressing towards fully realized, self-sustaining institutions. This process involves making strategic decisions such as shutting down non-viable ideas, merging similar initiatives, securing or protecting critical infrastructure, and making linear progress towards commercialization. The process also allows for companies to move back from right to left if new information or a change in business hypothesis requires it.
        As companies move towards step 5, there is a significant multiple of value creation due to real customers, commercial models, liquidity, external investors, and a strong product-market fit. The process also emphasizes the importance of portfolio alignment, with companies viewed as part of a larger web rather than independent siloed ideas.
        Additionally, the company is prioritizing smart capital from strategic investors from different sources to diversify participation and has invested in additional talent to support this objective. This talent will focus on expanding the investment network and raising awareness of portfolio companies through strategic marketing intelligence, ensuring that investment pitches align with the new IOG corporate strategy.
        The company will also pilot a venture governance and servicing approach as ventures make their way through the process, continuously learning, improving, and refining things. This will inform the design for a venture studio with a web3 focus and define long-term relationships with web3-launched-ventures, taking an integrated approach to portfolio management."
"Explore the IOG Venture Studio Design and Strategy
By focusing our future Venture Studio on web 3 - we’re leaning into our strengths. Objective one will pilot venture governance, and objective three (this objective) will build it.
It’ll be a modular IOG corporate strategy that explores different things such as mergers and acquisitions, partnerships, or even acquiring a web3 Venture Studio that's already in the market.
Ecosystem Thinking
As one of our competitive advantages, we’re building an ‘ecosystem view.’ There's a lot of siloing in this organization, so we will build an advanced collaboration model that's going to work with the customer at the center of it.
Exponential Organization
There are many different perspectives one can take to view IOG. Let’s get oriented.
This view shows us how we stage the growth of the company. This is a single functional view, and as we go through this journey we’ll develop other views on things like capability, accountability, and governance. Thinking of ourselves as an integration engine brings us together to work seamlessly as a strategic operations function.
We want to make things small so we have really agile and accountable groups, facilitated by that form and function. When we pull structures apart in the right way, they produce emergent value to each other.
Where do you go if you want to build a Venture Studio? Well, you need a hub!
About 90% of the world's venture capital and startups sit in such hubs. A hub liberates you to build a campus in a place that maximizes lifestyle. As we get deeper into the year, we'll start exploring places for the idea and protocols to be grown - kind of like our own
Bell Labs
.
It’s not a priority for this year, but we're committed to this model. Hopefully, it will inspire entire generations of people who go through it. It’ll be our legacy as an organization, and the nerve center upon which we innovate.
The New IOG Brand
In terms of the IOG brand, this year we’re prioritizing getting really clear about the identity of the company. We want to have a crystalized image of who we are, we want to consistently honor that image in all our communications (internal and external), and we want to lead every interaction with authenticity.","How does IOG's venture studio strategy aim to utilize an 'ecosystem view' and potential mergers, acquisitions, or partnerships to build a modular corporate strategy focused on web 3?","IOG's venture studio strategy aims to build a modular corporate strategy focused on web 3 by utilizing an 'ecosystem view' and potentially pursuing mergers, acquisitions, or partnerships. The 'ecosystem view' is a competitive advantage that IOG is building, which involves creating an advanced collaboration model with the customer at the center. This approach aims to break down silos within the organization and facilitate the growth of the company through a single functional view. As part of this strategy, IOG is considering the possibility of acquiring a web3 Venture Studio that is already in the market. Additionally, the venture studio will explore different things such as mergers, acquisitions, or partnerships to expand its capabilities and offerings in the web 3 space. The goal is to create a hub that will serve as a campus for the idea and protocols to be grown, similar to Bell Labs, which will inspire future generations and serve as the nerve center for innovation within the organization."
"Improve Efficiency and Effectiveness
PI planning has made big strides in 2023, and there's more wins on the way this year in terms of reducing bureaucracy, and improving overall effectiveness. We’ll also roll out the PI process to different functions, such as the President's Office.
Provide Excellent, Customized Services
The Operations team is evolving to support the spin out entities on continuous improvement and budgeting, too.
Create A Predictable and Reliable Operating System
Underpinned by performance metrics to support shared service delivery and the spin out process, we will develop and implement continuous improvement strategy for business operations. There will also be a focus on supporting quarterly executive planning with budget inputs.
Our budget process is a great example of how we’re already improving the process this year:
We’re aligning budget check-ins to quarterly deliverable cycles and PI Planning to better understand budget health through the year
Adopting a strategy led budgeting process to provide a north star to inform the resources required to support the roadmap
We’re utilizing data to tell the budget story - for example, a spin out will require a higher marketing spend when they’re ready to launch
We’re also connecting budgets to value demos to understand the actual spend and value delivered to help us make proactive decisions","How is the PI planning process being leveraged to improve efficiency and effectiveness, and what role does the Operations team play in supporting continuous improvement and budgeting for spin out entities?","The PI planning process is being leveraged to improve efficiency and effectiveness by reducing bureaucracy and improving overall effectiveness.

"There's an enormous amount of raw value that's been constructed within the Cardano ecosystem:
The DAP (decentralized app) portfolio
The sovereign wealth fund of Cardano
The network effect of the ecosystem
The brand value
And more...
We're still very committed to Cardano, and we’re repositioning ourselves to a role where we have a healthy, productive, well-managed relationship with the ecosystem. In this new relationship we’ll get to create value together, but at the same time, we get to keep doing the things that we love.
Cardano 2.0
Cardano 2.0 is our future vision of Cardano, as partners within the community. This research-focused vision is the extension of our first paper
Why Cardano
.
Our first workshop on this kicked off with the end in mind. We started with questions like:
how do we eclipse all other cryptocurrencies and become the world standard? What would a trillion dollar ecosystem look like?
This brought us back to the philosophical guts of our research agenda. It's easy to build systems that have lots of features and capabilities, but those systems do not necessarily have the same philosophical compatibility when we talk about cryptocurrencies, for example: centralization and inclusive accountability.
Therefore, the need for tenets becomes critical. As design principles and goals within the Cardano constitution in the future, tenets will help the community steer the vision.
We have this meta problem when we talk about a decentralized ecosystem - there’s no single person making decisions. The only way to deliver the Cardano vision is to write down these tenets, and make a proposal to the community for ratification.
Similar to the Bill of Rights in the US Constitution, these tenets are telling you -
a user of the system
- that certain things that you think are true, will stay true in the protocol: you're not going to have your funds locked, your transactions are not going to be blocked, and you're not going to be prevented from deploying an application. You can't be censored in that dimension.
The system will safely preserve the value and information that you decide to store in it. Meaning, you're not going to have somebody edit the blockchain because it's inconvenient to them. If we put it in the constitution, we put it into the design language, and we put it into the roadmap. Not only do we preserve these types of things, but we find a way to stay competitive.
When you widen the aperture, this will be one of the biggest differentiators between us and other web3 ecosystems. Our ecosystem wears its values on its sleeve, and we care so much about them that we're prepared to commit ourselves to long arc research agendas and product development. We've aligned our community to agree that these things are fundamental rights that matter.
IOG - The Cardano Community Member
We’re active members of the Cardano community through the Intersect Board and the Intersect Civics Committee. Together, we’re convening the constitution workshops and the ratification of the constitution.
We’re also supporting them in the development of their open-source, fit-for-purpose, product backlog process for Cardano - ensuring it’s process driven, and collaborative. In the same vein, we’ll also serve on numerous technical steering committees and working groups, including the Cardano Foundation (CF). This work shows our commitment to Cardano.
Cardano Innovation and Ecosystem Experts
As we help define and innovate the Cardano ecosystem, we refine our own ecosystem design and innovation skills. Within this objective, we’ll continue to evolve Catalyst as a critical role in the ecosystem, too.
Cardano Value Model
As we define how we participate in the Cardano ecosystem, we will identify how we give back, and also how to leverage a lot of really interesting things within the ecosystem as a value model. This would include sourcing new deals or new product ideas for our future Venture Studio.
We're also going to be securing a long-term vendor contract with the Intersect and the Dev Trust for IOI.",How will the proposed tenets in the Cardano constitution ensure the preservation and protection of user value and information within the decentralized ecosystem?,"The proposed tenets in the Cardano constitution will ensure the preservation and protection of user value and information within the decentralized ecosystem by committing to long-term research agendas and product development that prioritize decentralization and inclusive accountability. These tenets will be written down and proposed to the community for ratification, serving as design principles and goals within the Cardano constitution. They will tell users that certain things will stay true in the protocol, such as the inability to have funds locked, transactions blocked, or applications prevented from deployment. The system will safely preserve the value and information that users decide to store in it, and no one will be able to edit the blockchain because it's inconvenient for them. This commitment to values and rights will differentiate the Cardano ecosystem from other web3 ecosystems and ensure the long-term preservation and protection of user value and information."
"Review Our Employee Value Proposition
We want to grow our people and culture capabilities and create a culture first approach to everything we do. We have an amazing corporate strategy, and we believe that capturing, harnessing, and deploying our culture in a strategic way will help us drive that overarching strategy forward. In order to realize that, we first have to get really focused on employee experience, which anchors on the employee lifecycle.
Improve Retention, Sustainability, and Productivity
A big part of this objective is going to be defining and building a next level, data informed, customer-centric, employee life cycle capability. This capability will be like a center of excellence, serving as a central point of cultural coordination between the teams and capabilities that touch the employee experience.
We want to have an amazing value proposition that will help attract talent, and retain them through employee growth, engagement, and career planning and development.We’ll partner with the Talent Acquisition team to make sure we're attracting top talent that mesh as well with our culture.
Robust Internal Communication
Internal communication is a huge capability to deliver our people and culture objectives. This year you’ll see us invest in a robust internal comms layer that prioritizes transparency and cultural integration.
We’ve already made huge strides by introducing an intranet, which will continue to grow and evolve this year, with your input. Through this channel, and the evolution of our other key internal channels like our Town Hall, you’ll access timely, effective and relevant information to support you in your role.","What is the role of the proposed central point of cultural coordination in realizing the company's goal of harnessing and deploying its culture in a strategic way to improve retention, sustainability, and productivity?","The proposed central point of cultural coordination will serve as a hub for all things related to employee experience, which is a key component of the company's goal of harnessing and deploying its culture in a strategic way to improve retention, sustainability, and productivity. This central point will coordinate the efforts of various teams and capabilities that touch the employee experience, ensuring that there is a consistent and cohesive approach to culture-building. By defining and building a next level, data-informed, customer-centric, employee life cycle capability, the company will be able to attract and retain top talent, as well as support their growth, engagement, and career development. This, in turn, will lead to improved retention, sustainability, and productivity. Additionally, the company will invest in a robust internal comms layer that prioritizes transparency and cultural integration, which will further support the efforts of the central point of cultural coordination."

The result is non-aligned disconnected strategies and activities on various downstream levels due to lack of upper level information.
Examples of wrong order include: IT strategy should be ready before business strategy, OKRs and KPIs should be known before business processes are identified, or resource optimisation should be finished before financial planning. Naturally, there are much more dependencies between the deliverables than these three sample dependency chains.

Below is an illustration of the Enterprise Service Products OVS steps, with its service products and business capabilities, that delineates the process of generating and accumulating value, alongside the value proposition for each step of the value stream, and the outcomes for value exchange.
Product Development - Development Value Stream
The first four steps of the Enterprise Service Products OVS form the Product Development Development Value Stream (DVS) to produce new products and iterations to the existing products. The strength of the approach is two fold: On one hand the same DVS can produce the Enterprise Solution Delivery DVS and on the other hand, the outcome value of the value stream steps of the Product Development DVS can be offered as service products in the Enterprise Service Products OVS.
In the Product Development DVS, the value stream steps work together following the DevOps best practices, and the last two steps from development to operations can apply GitOps for continuous seamless delivery.

"Summary
In the heart of the Business Operating System is the Business Change Delivery Pipeline, a comprehensive framework designed to streamline the implementation of business changes across an organisation. It facilitates the alignment of strategic objectives with operational activities, ensuring that all levels of the company, from the executive board down to individual development teams, work towards a unified vision.
This approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also fosters innovation by integrating technology-driven initiatives critical for maintaining competitive advantage. However, the complexity of coordinating such a widespread organisational effort introduces potential risks and conflicts, necessitating robust IT systems for governance.
Introduction
Essentially, the Business Change Delivery Pipeline offers a strategic and structured approach to implementing change within an organisation. By leveraging automation and IT systems, companies can overcome potential risks and conflicts, ensuring that their strategic objectives are achieved through efficient and effective operational execution.
The Business Change Delivery Pipeline embodies a structured methodology for enacting transformation within an organisation's business model, ensuring a seamless transition from strategic planning to operational execution. This pipeline serves as the backbone of business change, guiding the flow of initiatives from the conception of strategic themes by the executive board through to their implementation by various teams within the organisation.
Managing the risk of complexity
Successful implementation of the Business Change Delivery Pipeline leads to a more agile and responsive organisation, capable of quickly adapting to market changes and internal strategic shifts that are many in the emerging technology markets. However, the complexity of managing numerous initiatives across different teams and functions can introduce risks and conflicts, particularly in terms of resource allocation and prioritisation of projects.
Implementing Business Change Delivery
Understanding the flow and the benefits
The Business Change Delivery Pipeline initiates at the strategic level, where the Executive Board articulates the business model, including the value proposition, products, and revenue streams, to provide a transparent understanding of how the enterprise operates, see the illustration below.
Unfortunately, many organisations fail at this first step by merely publishing a vague slide deck, which makes it difficult to guide the resources to contribute to their vision. It is significant the Executive Board expresses the company's strategy in an implementable manner, laying down the groundwork for operational planning and execution. This strategic direction, expressed as Strategic Themes, is then translated into actionable objectives, with funding allocated specifically to initiatives that align with the company's strategic themes, ensuring that every change contributes directly to the overarching goals of the organisation.
Funding is strategically allocated to initiatives that support and combine both operational model changes and product innovations. This framework cascades down to technology and operational planning, where enterprise architects, alongside portfolio and product managers, employ advanced working methods and automation to realise the strategic objectives. Enabler and Business Epics are identified and prioritised to form a coherent Portfolio Vision and Roadmap, guiding the development within Business Capabilities.
One of the core benefits of this approach is the creation of a transparent and coherent framework that aligns all the levels of the organisation, from portfolio managers and product managers to development teams, towards common strategic objectives. This alignment enhances efficiency, reduces redundancy, and ensures that operational changes and technology initiatives are directly contributing to the strategic competitive advantage of the company.
Step-by-Step Flow of Business Change Delivery
The business model
implements the transparent understanding how the enterprise operates, incl. value proposition, products, revenue streams, resources and processes.
The Executive Board publishes the company strategy in an implementable way to ensure a single source for ""
strategic themes
"" that are easy to align through the organisation.
Clear division
how we change our company
, i.e., the business operating system / the operating model, and our products in synergy. (Tip: In product-oriented organisations, too often operations come as an after-thought.)
""
Strategic Objectives Alignment
"" is the budgeting method where the funding is granted only to the initiatives supporting the strategic themes. (Tip: Important to avoid funding allocation based on the organisational structure rather than the business strategy and objectives.)
In technology-driven organisations or in digital transformation, technology initiatives are needed for the strategic competitive advantage and they impact greatly the financial allocations. This is the level where portfolio managers, product managers and enterprise architects operate, i.e.,
how to use advanced working methods and automation
to achieve the strategic company objectives.
The business change is implemented in Technology Enablement Epics (
Enabler Epics
) and
Business Epics
with the understanding which Enabler Epics are needed for which Business Epics made of Business Features. Together with enterprise architects, solution architects work on producing solution scenarios to build the technology initiatives.
As a combination, Enabler Epics and Business Epics form a
Portfolio Vision
, i.e.,
what should be built
, and Portfolio Roadmap, i.e.,
in which order
the Epics need to be built. (Tip: Not to be mixed up with aspirational milestones set by sales.)
The enterprise is managed as
Business Capabilities
that create the Operational Value Stream(s). Business Capabilities are as independent as possible, potentially inside domains. They may run on enterprise platforms. Solution architects work inside Business Capabilities as SMEs on specific services and/or platforms.

. All the software teams serve the Release Trains and their cadence.
The software teams are divided into three categories: Shared Services Teams, Development
Teams, and Platform Teams. Embedded technical architects help the teams in solving particular design challenges. The reponsibilities of the teams divide as follows:
In the Release Train,
Development Teams
develop Features making Epics.
In the Release Train,
Shared Services Teams
develop specialty Features and their parts together with several other teams.
Platform Teams
offer services inside Business Capabilities, such as connection to enterprise integration platform, cloud platform specific configuration, customer data platform administration, data curation, etc. To summarise, the main task of the Platform Teams is to ensure the platforms offer all the features needed by the Release Train in time.
Business Change Delivery Automation
Choosing the right automation
To mitigate the challenges stemming from the organisational complexity, the Business Change Delivery Pipeline should be supported by automation and robust IT systems, which play a crucial role in ensuring the smooth flow of information and resources throughout the pipeline. For the organisation following agile principles and methodologies at the enterprise level, focusing on adaptability, flexibility, and responsiveness to change, Enterprise Agile Planning (EAP) tools and frameworks support the essential dynamic prioritisation of initiatives. EAP fosters collaboration across teams enabling faster decision-making and implementation in line with changing market demands and strategic objectives.
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are comprehensive software platforms designed to integrate and manage all the core processes of an organisation, from finance and HR to supply chain, operations, services, and technology. ERP systems aim to streamline business processes, improve data visibility across departments, and enhance overall operational efficiency by providing a single source of truth. They are traditionally associated with more rigid, structured planning and execution methodologies, focusing on optimisation, control, and predictability.
Notably, EAP is not a software system like ERP but a strategic approach supported by various tools designed to implement agile methodologies across upscaling and large organisations. EAP is more suitable for an organisation operating in dynamic markets where the ability to quickly adapt to change is a competitive advantage. For the Business Change Delivery Pipeline, particularly in contexts emphasising innovation, technology-driven transformation, and the need for rapid implementation of strategic initiatives, EAP aligns better with these objectives. However, ERP and EAP can be complementary, with ERP providing the operational backbone and EAP guiding the strategic and agile execution of business change initiatives.
Key IT systems and the delivery tool chain
These key IT systems must not only facilitate strategic planning and operational execution but also enable robust management of innovation, financials, and targeted customer value. When selecting IT systems for these needs, it is important to prioritise integration capabilities to ensure seamless data flow and visibility across the organisation. Notably, some platforms offer multiple functionalities, reducing the need for disparate systems, different vendors, and added integration overhead.
For instance, some comprehensive Project Portfolio Management platforms include features for financial operations, cost management, and even aspects of business capability management. Similarly, advanced EAP tools offer features that support aspects of innovation management and delivery pipeline automation. By carefully selecting systems that can cover multiple requirements, the organisation can streamline the IT infrastructure, reduce complexity, and improve the effectiveness of the Business Change Delivery Pipeline.
Enterprise Agile Planning (EAP) Tool:
This tool supports agile planning and execution at scale, integrating with development tools to provide real-time visibility into progress, priorities, and resource allocation. An EAP tool enables the coordination of strategic initiatives across various teams and departments, facilitating agile methodologies throughout the organisation. (

In the budget proposal for 2024
)
Business Capability Management System:
System, often integrated inside the EAM software, designed to map, analyse, and manage business capabilities, ensuring that the organisation's operational capabilities align with strategic objectives. This system should integrate with EA and EAP tools to provide a holistic view of how capabilities support strategic initiatives. (
In the budget proposal for 2024
)
DevOps and Continuous Delivery Pipeline Tools:
Tools that automate the software development lifecycle, from code integration to deployment, supporting the rapid delivery of business change initiatives. For oversight, these tools should integrate with EAP tools to align development activities with agile planning processes on a portfolio level. (
In the budget proposal for 2024
)
Project Portfolio Management (PPM) and Financial Operations Software:
A comprehensive platform that supports the prioritisation and management of projects and initiatives based on strategic alignment and financial performance. This software should include capabilities for standardised cost management and financial monitoring, ensuring that financial allocations among epics and initiatives are effectively and fairly managed. (
In the budget proposal for 2024
)
Product and Customer Value Management Platform:
System designed to manage various product portfolios and measure customer value, integrating customer feedback and market trends into the product development lifecycle. These platforms should link with EAP and innovation management tools to ensure that product strategies align with overall business objectives and customer needs. (
In the budget proposal for 2024
)
Additionally, platforms for collaboration and communication, such as enterprise social networks, online instant messaging and meeting tools, are essential for maintaining alignment and fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation across the organisation.","How does the Business Change Delivery Pipeline align strategic objectives with operational activities to ensure all levels of an organization work towards a unified vision, and what potential risks and conflicts can arise from its implementation?","The Business Change Delivery Pipeline is a comprehensive framework designed to streamline the implementation of business changes across an organization. It aligns strategic objectives with operational activities, ensuring that all levels of the company work towards a unified vision. This approach enhances operational efficiency and fosters innovation by integrating technology-driven initiatives critical for maintaining competitive advantage. However, potential risks and conflicts can arise from its implementation due to the complexity of coordinating such a widespread organizational effort, necessitating robust IT systems for governance.

        The Business Change Delivery Pipeline initiates at the strategic level, where the Executive Board articulates the business model, including the value proposition, products, and revenue streams, to provide a transparent understanding of how the enterprise operates. This strategic direction, expressed as Strategic Themes, is then translated into actionable objectives, with funding allocated specifically to initiatives that align with the company's strategic themes, ensuring that every change contributes directly to the overarching goals of the organization.

        Funding is strategically allocated to initiatives that support and combine both operational model changes and product innovations. This framework cascades down to technology and operational planning, where enterprise architects, alongside portfolio and product managers, employ advanced working methods and automation to realize the strategic objectives. Enabler and Business Epics are identified and prioritized to form a coherent Portfolio Vision and Roadmap, guiding the development within Business Capabilities.

        One of the core benefits of this approach is the creation of a transparent and coherent framework that aligns all the levels of the organization, from portfolio managers and product managers to development teams, towards common strategic objectives. This alignment enhances efficiency, reduces redundancy, and ensures that operational changes and technology initiatives are directly contributing to the strategic competitive advantage of the company.

        However, the complexity of managing numerous initiatives across different teams and functions can introduce risks and conflicts, particularly in terms of resource allocation and prioritization of projects. Implementing robust IT systems and automation can help mitigate these challenges, ensuring the smooth flow of information and resources throughout the pipeline."

figure out the delivery team and assignee who will be driving a particular Jira ticket to its resolution:
if it is something that
can
be resolved by this triage team (usually, it is documentation, questions, clarifications, etc.), someone from the triage team gets assigned to it
If it is something that
can’t
be resolved by the triage team (usually, it is code issues), the triage team figures out to which development team the Jira ticket at hand belongs, and it gets assigned to the Delivery Lead/PM on this development team. The Delivery Lead/PM is notified and expected to drive the assigned Jira ticket to its resolution.
Also, on each comms triage call, we review the progress on all the previously triaged open tickets.
3.How We Collect Community Feedback
The users are informed to log their
tech issues
on relevant github repositories (i.e. cadano-node for node issues, plutus for plutus issues, dbsync for dbsync issues)
Also, the comms folks involved in this process check various comms channels daily (or several times a day) to capture unanswered questions, concerns, and not-tech issues. Currently, this feedback ends up on the following
comms tracking spreadsheet
managed by
Rebecca Hopwood (Unlicensed)
- going forward, we will see if we can get this feedback logged in Jira from the get-go. All the new things on the
comms tracking spreadsheet
are triaged on the next triage call and get logged in Jira.

"Background
This project was initiated to explore potential opportunities for building a monitoring service for dApps operating on Cardano. The study aimed to assess users’ and market needs regarding such a solution.  We decided to conduct interviews with potential users of such service to determine their current behavior and needs unmet at the time being.
This is a summary of the current state of the project as for 31st January 2024. The aim of this summary is to highlight existing findings and create recommendations for next steps and further research.
Methodology
Methodology and participants recruitment
Individual interviews conducted by two moderators: UX Researcher and and Product Manager. All interviews were recorded
Some interviews included interacting with an Ethereum product, used as a stimuli to explain the idea, potential architecture and desired features for Cardano dApps monitoring service
Participants were invited to participate by the Product Manager, no public announcement about this study was made
Interviewee profiles
In total, we interviewed 7 people among all target groups.
1 interview was excluded from analysis. In that interview, we could not find any insights contributing to our research questions and participant’s perspective was too personal and too technical.
Below is an overview of requirements for each target group.
Auditors
DApp Operators
Wallets
Total interviewed: 2
Total interviewed: 0
Total interviewed: 5
Excluded from analysis: 1
Individuals conducting dApps audits, particularly on Cardano
Representatives of following consultancies: Vacuum Labs, MLabs
At the moment of conducting this phase of research, we did not have access to participants from this segment
Lace wallet experts:
Experts building dApp store
Experts building Lace wallet
Recommendations:
If dApp operators are considered a potential buyers or users of dApp monitoring service, they should be represented in the exploratory research.
At the moment of closing this project, the ratio for IOG external and internal research participants is 2/5. More research with potential external users is recomended to evaluate the idea.

Benefits of historical data analysis were mentioned multiple times. There is no evidence that users are skilled in this analysis
Research Findings
Needs, Current Behaviours and Alternatives
Insight 1:  Auditors currently do not monitor dApps
Auditors emphasise the absence of monitoring in their current approach, considering it post-audit and post-deployment.
As reasons, auditors point to challenge of conducting meaningful, in-depth statistical analysis, lack of maturity of dApps and resource constraints
A monitoring solution needs to be carefully defined and address compexity of monitoring multi-step processes, such as batching.

Insight in Dovetail:
https://blithesome-heather-h6jf.dovetail.com/insights/Auditors-currently-do-not-monitor-dApps-35eV8hhvYwSnG5LuTOjP7w
Recommendation:
Auditors believe that dApps do not monitor their activity, as there are not enough mature projects in production and auditing companies do not get many requests for monitoring. This might be an assumption and might be validated with dApps operators.
Insight 2: Experts believe that there are no tools on Cardano to monitor dApps
Both, IOG internal and external experts emphasize gaps in auditing practices and monitoring tools within the Cardano ecosystem.
Specifically in relation to monitoring user activity on dApp.

"Alberto
Stefano, the product manager for the certification program at IOG, introduces a new platform they're developing to test applications within the Cardano ecosystem. This platform focuses on automatic and property-based testing. Stefano invites feedback from any stakeholders, including developers and those planning to develop applications within the Cardano ecosystem. Romain, Stefano's colleague, is the tech lead for this platform.
Alberto, a young developer from South America, shares his background in blockchain, starting with Ethereum in 2018 and transitioning to the Cardano network in 2020. He operates a stake pool in the Cardano network and aims to use the pool to fund high school-level projects, as he believes these projects can make a significant impact.
Romain, the tech lead, introduces himself and his role in developing certification tools and defining certification levels for Cardano DApps. His background includes ten years of formal verification for critical embedded systems before moving to blockchain and IOG.
Stefano inquires about Alberto's testing processes and the tools he uses. Alberto explains that he primarily uses the playground and appreciates its visual input/output. He also uses Haskell for his main programming language and Lucid for creating a visual interface for the Cardano CLI. Alberto wishes for a more fully integrated ecosystem of tools from IOG, which is being developed.
Romain describes the automated testing tool they're developing. It aims for level one certification, meaning it tests as much as possible using property-based testing. It also conducts coverage analysis and plans to integrate more features in the future. Certificates, indicating the level of certification, will be available on-chain.
Alberto shows interest in this certification program, as he needs to gain the trust of his stakeholders for his intelligent stake pool. He considers certification a good way to gain that trust. However, he also brings up a valid point that the cost of this product might deter start-up developers who could alternatively gain user trust by sharing their code with the community for free.
Stefano acknowledges the potential hurdle of cost for start-ups but also considers that these developers might want to test their code to a certain degree before sharing it with the public. He inquires if Alberto would be willing to buy this product for around $1,000 per year to gain user trust. Alberto believes that while the cost might scare off smaller developers, more established and well-funded projects wouldn't have a problem with it.
Lastly, Stefano asks about the potential for a discount for special purposes, like schools or foundations. Alberto appreciates the idea but brings up the difficulty of certifying whether a group is actually a school. He suggests the discount might be more beneficial and secure for foundations that already have legal contributions.

Patrick
Part One:
Patrik Suzzi and Stefano Leone are discussing the concept of teaching programming to individuals.
Suzzi states that the process should be more hands-on and interactive rather than theoretical, which would be more engaging for beginners.
He supports the idea of using real examples, especially ones from reputable sources, to enhance learning.
Suzzi also mentions the potential of ChatGPT as a teaching tool, but emphasizes the need for human supervision.
Part Two:
Suzzi advocates for opening access to programming and making it more approachable for beginners.
He emphasizes the need for a clear, simple index or guide that can help new programmers navigate the learning process.
They discuss the use of AI like ChatGPT for simple tasks, but warn against over-reliance on it due to possible inaccuracies.
They talk about a product that assists in testing applications, running property-based testing, checking for vulnerabilities, and certifying on-chain efforts.
Part Three:
Suzzi and Leone discuss the cost of the testing and certification service, with Suzzi expressing concern about the high subscription cost, especially for smaller projects or businesses.
Leone introduces an early access program that allows potential users to try the tool for free in exchange for feedback.
Suzzi expresses potential interest in this program but notes it would depend on whether he has an app to test at the time.
The conversation ends with Suzzi expressing a willingness to contribute to Cardano-related projects and Leone thanking Suzzi for his time.","""Considering Alberto's need to gain user trust for his intelligent stake pool and the potential hurdle of cost for start-ups in the automated testing tool developed by Stefano's team, what could be a suitable solution to address both trust and affordability concerns for different types of developers within the Cardano ecosystem?""","A suitable solution to address both trust and affordability concerns for different types of developers within the Cardano ecosystem could be a tiered pricing model for the automated testing tool. This model could offer a basic free version for start-ups and smaller projects, allowing them to test their code to a certain degree before sharing it with the public. For more established and well-funded projects, a paid version with advanced features and full certification could be available at a higher price point, such as $1,000 per year, as suggested by Stefano. Additionally, a discounted rate could be offered for special purposes, such as schools or foundations, to ensure that they can also benefit from the tool while maintaining trust and security. This approach would cater to the needs of different types of developers within the Cardano ecosystem, providing them with an affordable and accessible solution to gain user trust and ensure the quality of their applications."
"Mail for Charli3 and Sundaeswap:
Subject: Introducing Our New Cardano DApp Testing Application - Your Feedback Needed!
Dear
[Recipient's Name]
,
I hope that things are going well for you, and that you’re keeping busy!
We’ve discussed IOG’s certification programme before, and I appreciate your support for the idea of giving users as much assurance as possible about DApp behaviour. The programme envisages assurance of three different kinds: testing (level 1), audit (level 2) and formal verification (level), as well as publishing that information in the Lace wallet DApp store built by IOG, as well as in others. The mechanism for that is for the DApp store to read the certification information off the chain, and to present it prominently to users in the store.
As you may remember, as a part of this, IOG is building a level 1 tool to test DApps, using property-based testing, and publishing certification information on chain for later display in the DApp store. I'm excited to share that our product is now in the final stages of development, and we are preparing for its launch soon. By using our product, developers could avoid:
Errors, leading to reputational damage
Loss of users/customers
Future costs for repairing preventable damage
As someone who has shown interest in certification, I would like to ask for your feedback. Specifically, we'd like to know if you would consider paying a subscription for this tool once it becomes available, at a price that we could discuss further if you're interested.
Your input is invaluable to us, and it will help us shape our product and pricing strategy to best serve the needs of developers like you.
Please let me know if you'd be willing to share your thoughts, and I'd be happy to schedule a call or discuss this further via email.
Thank you in advance for your time and input.

t's care, while ensuring its continuous evolution and operational effectiveness.
Key objectives include:
Sustainable Open Source Transition
: Ensure the tool's functionality is preserved and enhanced within an open-source framework, making it accessible for broad community use and contribution.
Model Checker Integration and Tool Expansion
: We plan to integrate the IOI Model Checker for formal verification alongside property-based testing within the tool.
This dual approach is crucial, particularly for testing Smart Contracts with off-chain code, where formal verification alone might not capture all potential issues.
The goal is to extend the tool's utility for both L1 and L3 certificate testing, ensuring comprehensive coverage. This expansion will support a wider array of Smart Contract languages through UPC and provide native support for Aiken and Plu-TS, thereby enhancing the tool's versatility and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities.
Cloud-Based SaaS Platform Management
: The plan proposes a cloud-hosted SaaS platform for the IOG Testing Tool, to be commissioned by Intersect (or by any other third party) and potentially executed by IOG and IOI. This setup would allow Intersect (and other third parties) to serve as a trusted entity, capable of issuing certifications for tested Smart Contracts, ensuring broad access and maintaining the tool's integrity.
Additionally, the enablement of certification capabilities supports broader IOG product strategies, such as the Lace Wallet and the Dapp Store, emphasizing the ecosystem's dedication to security and trust.
IOG and other third parties, compensated for their services, would manage the tool's cloud infrastructure, promoting reliability and trust in the certification process within the Cardano ecosystem.
Community Engagement and Training
: Offer comprehensive training sessions and materials for both new users and contributors, fostering an informed and active community around the tool.
1. Open Source Transition
Finalize and document all existing code to ensure it is ready for open-source release.
License the tool under an appropriate open-source license that supports community contributions while protecting the project's integrity.
Transfer all relevant GitHub repositories from IOG to Intersect.
2. Web Interface and Backend Maintenance
Ensure the web-based interface and backend are fully documented and modular to facilitate community contributions and future enhancements.
Establish a maintenance team responsible for reviewing contributions, managing pull requests, and ensuring the tool's stability and security.
3. Testing Approaches and Support
Provide comprehensive documentation on testing approaches for L1 (property-based testing) and L3 (formal verification) through a model checker.
Ensure support for surface languages through UPC and native support for Aiken and Plu-TS.
Develop a clear guide for extending the tool to support additional languages and frameworks.
4. Local Installation and SaaS Configurations
Local Installation:
Package the tool for easy download and installation on various operating systems, ensuring compatibility for running on local machines.
In the documentation, clearly state that while the tool is fully functional and powerful,
it does not issue certifications
when installed locally due to limitations in the trust model.
SaaS Configuration:
Configure the tool for deployment on a cloud platform, enabling it as a SaaS offering. This setup allows for centralized updates, management, and
certification issuance
.
Ensure the SaaS platform maintains high security and reliability standards, facilitating the tool's ability to issue trusted certifications for Smart Contracts tested through the service.
5. Intersect Collaboration
Formalize an agreement with Intersect for them to offer the tool as a SaaS platform, hosted on cloud infrastructure provided by IOG and IOI.
Outline a process for Intersect to request new developments based on community feedback, with IOG and IOI serving as (preferred) development partners.
Activate a module for Intersect to issue certifications for dApps that meet L1 and L3 testing requirements through their SaaS platform.
6. Community Engagement and Governance
Create a governance model for the project that includes representatives from IOI, the Cardano ecosystem, Intersect, and the broader developer community.
Plan regular community calls, hackathons, and contribution drives to encourage active participation in the tool’s development and maintenance.
7. Documentation
Develop extensive documentation covering the tool's use, extension, and contribution guidelines.
8. Monitoring and Reporting
Implement a system for monitoring the tool’s usage, contribution activity, and overall health of the project.
Provide regular reports to the community on development progress, new features, and usage statistics.
9. New Development Proposals
Model Checker Integration
: Plan to integrate the IOI Model Checker with the property-based testing approach for Level 1 certificates. This will allow formal verification of smart contracts written in Plutus TX, enhancing the tool's capability to ensure the reliability and security of smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain.
Aiken and Plu-TS Native Support:
While the tool currently supports any surface language via UPC, we propose to implement native support for Aiken and Plu-TS if demanded by the community. This would streamline testing processes for developers using these languages.
Marketplace for Modules
: Develop a framework and guidelines for a marketplace where developers can offer additional modules for the tool, thereby extending its functionality. It's crucial that this marketplace maintains the same high quality standards as the main tool to ensure consistency and reliability.
Training and Education
: Offer training sessions and materials for both new users and contributors to build a knowledgeable and engaged community. This initiative will help users understand how to effectively utilize the tool and encourage contributions that drive the tool's development forward.

        Firstly, the integration of the IOI Model Checker for formal verification alongside property-based testing within the tool creates a dual approach to testing. This dual approach is particularly crucial for testing Smart Contracts with off-chain code, where formal verification alone might not capture all potential issues. By combining these two methods, the tool can provide a more comprehensive coverage for both L1 and L3 certificate testing, thereby increasing its ability to identify vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts.

        Secondly, the expansion of supported Smart Contract languages through UPC and native support for Aiken and Plu-TS enhances the tool's versatility. This expansion allows the tool to support a wider array of Smart Contract languages, which is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in a diverse range of Smart Contracts. By supporting more languages, the tool can be used by a broader range of developers, which can lead to the identification of a wider range of vulnerabilities.

        Lastly, the expansion of supported Smart Contract languages also increases the tool's effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities. By providing native support for Aiken and Plu-TS, the tool can streamline the testing process for developers using these languages. This can lead to more efficient testing, which can increase the likelihood of identifying vulnerabilities. Additionally, the tool's ability to support any surface language via UPC allows it to be used with a wide range of Smart Contracts, which can increase its effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities."

nn/mm/24 (+2mth)","What is the current process for triaging and addressing Chang H/F community support incidents on the Cardano testnet, and how are community feedback and incidents logged in Jira?","The current process for triaging and addressing Chang H/F community support incidents on the Cardano testnet involves an initial support triage group consisting of Engineering (Kevin Hammond) and Comms (Leonard Hegarty) who update asynchronously or in-person every workday to review all new untriaged community support incidents, set severity (impact) on Jira tickets, figure out the delivery team and assignee who will be driving a particular Jira ticket to its resolution, and review the progress on all previously triaged open tickets. Community feedback is collected through users logging tech issues on relevant Github repositories (cadano-node for node issues, plutus for plutus issues, dbsync for dbsync issues) and comms folks checking various comms channels daily to capture unanswered questions, concerns, and not-tech issues. The feedback ends up on a comms tracking spreadsheet managed by Rebecca Hopwood (Unlicensed) and is triaged on the next triage call and gets logged in Jira. To log Chang H/F community support incidents in Jira, navigate to the CHANG COMMUNITY BOARD Jira board, click on the “Create” button, fill in/select the following fields: Issue type ---> Bug, Summary ---> type the title of your incident here, Labels ---> always select the “Community_Bugs” label, Incident Source ---> select a source where your incident comes from, Incident Type ---> if it is clear what type, fill it in, Description ---> describe the incident here. Jira dropdown fields to be filled in/selected on community incident Jira tickets include Labels (Community_Bugs - always use this label when reporting comms incidents on Jira), Incident Type (Documentation, Code Issue, Code Enhancement, Question, FUD), Incident Source (Discord, Github, Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, IOG Slack, Direct Calls/Messages/Emails), Severity (Impact) Cardano H/F (Sev-1 Major, Sev-2 Sever, Sev-3 Moderate, Sev-4 Minor, Sev-5 Trivial), Delivery Team (the team assigned to resolve/handle incidents)."

"Background
This project was initiated to explore potential opportunities for building a monitoring service for dApps operating on Cardano. The study aimed to assess users’ and market needs regarding such a solution.  We decided to conduct interviews with potential users of such service to determine their current behavior and needs unmet at the time being.
This is a summary of the current state of the project as for 31st January 2024. The aim of this summary is to highlight existing findings and create recommendations for next steps and further research.
Methodology
Methodology and participants recruitment
Individual interviews conducted by two moderators: UX Researcher and and Product Manager. All interviews were recorded
Some interviews included interacting with an Ethereum product, used as a stimuli to explain the idea, potential architecture and desired features for Cardano dApps monitoring service
Participants were invited to participate by the Product Manager, no public announcement about this study was made
Interviewee profiles
In total, we interviewed 7 people among all target groups.
1 interview was excluded from analysis. In that interview, we could not find any insights contributing to our research questions and participant’s perspective was too personal and too technical.
Below is an overview of requirements for each target group.
Auditors
DApp Operators
Wallets
Total interviewed: 2
Total interviewed: 0
Total interviewed: 5
Excluded from analysis: 1
Individuals conducting dApps audits, particularly on Cardano
Representatives of following consultancies: Vacuum Labs, MLabs
At the moment of conducting this phase of research, we did not have access to participants from this segment
Lace wallet experts:
Experts building dApp store
Experts building Lace wallet
Recommendations:
If dApp operators are considered a potential buyers or users of dApp monitoring service, they should be represented in the exploratory research.
At the moment of closing this project, the ratio for IOG external and internal research participants is 2/5. More research with potential external users is recomended to evaluate the idea.

Benefits of historical data analysis were mentioned multiple times. There is no evidence that users are skilled in this analysis
Research Findings
Needs, Current Behaviours and Alternatives
Insight 1:  Auditors currently do not monitor dApps
Auditors emphasise the absence of monitoring in their current approach, considering it post-audit and post-deployment.
As reasons, auditors point to challenge of conducting meaningful, in-depth statistical analysis, lack of maturity of dApps and resource constraints
A monitoring solution needs to be carefully defined and address compexity of monitoring multi-step processes, such as batching.

"Alberto
Stefano, the product manager for the certification program at IOG, introduces a new platform they're developing to test applications within the Cardano ecosystem. This platform focuses on automatic and property-based testing. Stefano invites feedback from any stakeholders, including developers and those planning to develop applications within the Cardano ecosystem. Romain, Stefano's colleague, is the tech lead for this platform.
Alberto, a young developer from South America, shares his background in blockchain, starting with Ethereum in 2018 and transitioning to the Cardano network in 2020. He operates a stake pool in the Cardano network and aims to use the pool to fund high school-level projects, as he believes these projects can make a significant impact.
Romain, the tech lead, introduces himself and his role in developing certification tools and defining certification levels for Cardano DApps. His background includes ten years of formal verification for critical embedded systems before moving to blockchain and IOG.
Stefano inquires about Alberto's testing processes and the tools he uses. Alberto explains that he primarily uses the playground and appreciates its visual input/output. He also uses Haskell for his main programming language and Lucid for creating a visual interface for the Cardano CLI. Alberto wishes for a more fully integrated ecosystem of tools from IOG, which is being developed.
Romain describes the automated testing tool they're developing. It aims for level one certification, meaning it tests as much as possible using property-based testing. It also conducts coverage analysis and plans to integrate more features in the future. Certificates, indicating the level of certification, will be available on-chain.
Alberto shows interest in this certification program, as he needs to gain the trust of his stakeholders for his intelligent stake pool. He considers certification a good way to gain that trust. However, he also brings up a valid point that the cost of this product might deter start-up developers who could alternatively gain user trust by sharing their code with the community for free.
Stefano acknowledges the potential hurdle of cost for start-ups but also considers that these developers might want to test their code to a certain degree before sharing it with the public. He inquires if Alberto would be willing to buy this product for around $1,000 per year to gain user trust. Alberto believes that while the cost might scare off smaller developers, more established and well-funded projects wouldn't have a problem with it.
Lastly, Stefano asks about the potential for a discount for special purposes, like schools or foundations. Alberto appreciates the idea but brings up the difficulty of certifying whether a group is actually a school. He suggests the discount might be more beneficial and secure for foundations that already have legal contributions.

Patrick
Part One:
Patrik Suzzi and Stefano Leone are discussing the concept of teaching programming to individuals.
Suzzi states that the process should be more hands-on and interactive rather than theoretical, which would be more engaging for beginners.
He supports the idea of using real examples, especially ones from reputable sources, to enhance learning.
Suzzi also mentions the potential of ChatGPT as a teaching tool, but emphasizes the need for human supervision.
Part Two:
Suzzi advocates for opening access to programming and making it more approachable for beginners.
He emphasizes the need for a clear, simple index or guide that can help new programmers navigate the learning process.
They discuss the use of AI like ChatGPT for simple tasks, but warn against over-reliance on it due to possible inaccuracies.
They talk about a product that assists in testing applications, running property-based testing, checking for vulnerabilities, and certifying on-chain efforts.
Part Three:
Suzzi and Leone discuss the cost of the testing and certification service, with Suzzi expressing concern about the high subscription cost, especially for smaller projects or businesses.
Leone introduces an early access program that allows potential users to try the tool for free in exchange for feedback.
Suzzi expresses potential interest in this program but notes it would depend on whether he has an app to test at the time.
The conversation ends with Suzzi expressing a willingness to contribute to Cardano-related projects and Leone thanking Suzzi for his time.","""Considering Alberto's need to gain user trust for his intelligent stake pool and the high subscription cost of the testing and certification service, how might the early access program impact smaller developers or projects like Alberto's, and what potential alternatives could be proposed to address their concerns?""","The early access program could potentially impact smaller developers or projects like Alberto's by providing them with an opportunity to try the testing and certification service for free, in exchange for feedback. This could help them gauge the effectiveness of the service and determine if the cost is justified for their specific needs.
        
        However, the early access program might not be a viable solution for all smaller developers or projects, as it requires them to have an app to test during the program. Therefore, alternative solutions could be proposed to address their concerns regarding the high subscription cost.
        
        One potential alternative could be a tiered pricing model, where developers or projects with smaller budgets can opt for a more affordable plan that offers basic testing and certification features. This would allow them to still benefit from the service, while also making it more accessible and affordable for their specific needs.
        
        Another alternative could be offering discounts or subsidies for educational institutions, non-profit organizations, or startups. This would help support the growth and development of these entities, while also ensuring that they have access to the necessary testing and certification services.
        
        Lastly, IOG could consider partnering with funding organizations or investors that support blockchain projects. This would provide developers or projects with additional resources to cover the cost of the testing and certification service, while also helping to build trust and credibility within the Cardano ecosystem."

Subject: Introducing Our New Cardano DApp Testing Application - Your Feedback Needed!
Dear
[Recipient's Name]
,
I hope that things are going well for you, and that you’re keeping busy!
We’ve discussed IOG’s certification programme before, and I appreciate your support for the idea of giving users as much assurance as possible about DApp behaviour. The programme envisages assurance of three different kinds: testing (level 1), audit (level 2) and formal verification (level), as well as publishing that information in the Lace wallet DApp store built by IOG, as well as in others. The mechanism for that is for the DApp store to read the certification information off the chain, and to present it prominently to users in the store.
As you may remember, as a part of this, IOG is building a level 1 tool to test DApps, using property-based testing, and publishing certification information on chain for later display in the DApp store. I'm excited to share that our product is now in the final stages of development, and we are preparing for its launch soon. By using our product, developers could avoid:
Errors, leading to reputational damage
Loss of users/customers
Future costs for repairing preventable damage
As someone who has shown interest in certification, I would like to ask for your feedback. Specifically, we'd like to know if you would consider paying a subscription for this tool once it becomes available, at a price that we could discuss further if you're interested.
Your input is invaluable to us, and it will help us shape our product and pricing strategy to best serve the needs of developers like you.
Please let me know if you'd be willing to share your thoughts, and I'd be happy to schedule a call or discuss this further via email.
Thank you in advance for your time and input.
Best regards,

"Objective
The overarching goal of this handover plan is to facilitate the
IOG Testing Tool
's transition to the open-source domain, under the IOI, Cardano ecosystem and
Intersec
t's care, while ensuring its continuous evolution and operational effectiveness.
Key objectives include:
Sustainable Open Source Transition
: Ensure the tool's functionality is preserved and enhanced within an open-source framework, making it accessible for broad community use and contribution.
Model Checker Integration and Tool Expansion
: We plan to integrate the IOI Model Checker for formal verification alongside property-based testing within the tool.
This dual approach is crucial, particularly for testing Smart Contracts with off-chain code, where formal verification alone might not capture all potential issues.
The goal is to extend the tool's utility for both L1 and L3 certificate testing, ensuring comprehensive coverage. This expansion will support a wider array of Smart Contract languages through UPC and provide native support for Aiken and Plu-TS, thereby enhancing the tool's versatility and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities.
Cloud-Based SaaS Platform Management
: The plan proposes a cloud-hosted SaaS platform for the IOG Testing Tool, to be commissioned by Intersect (or by any other third party) and potentially executed by IOG and IOI. This setup would allow Intersect (and other third parties) to serve as a trusted entity, capable of issuing certifications for tested Smart Contracts, ensuring broad access and maintaining the tool's integrity.
Additionally, the enablement of certification capabilities supports broader IOG product strategies, such as the Lace Wallet and the Dapp Store, emphasizing the ecosystem's dedication to security and trust.
IOG and other third parties, compensated for their services, would manage the tool's cloud infrastructure, promoting reliability and trust in the certification process within the Cardano ecosystem.
Community Engagement and Training
: Offer comprehensive training sessions and materials for both new users and contributors, fostering an informed and active community around the tool.
1. Open Source Transition
Finalize and document all existing code to ensure it is ready for open-source release.
License the tool under an appropriate open-source license that supports community contributions while protecting the project's integrity.
Transfer all relevant GitHub repositories from IOG to Intersect.
2. Web Interface and Backend Maintenance
Ensure the web-based interface and backend are fully documented and modular to facilitate community contributions and future enhancements.
Establish a maintenance team responsible for reviewing contributions, managing pull requests, and ensuring the tool's stability and security.
3. Testing Approaches and Support
Provide comprehensive documentation on testing approaches for L1 (property-based testing) and L3 (formal verification) through a model checker.
Ensure support for surface languages through UPC and native support for Aiken and Plu-TS.
Develop a clear guide for extending the tool to support additional languages and frameworks.
4. Local Installation and SaaS Configurations
Local Installation:
Package the tool for easy download and installation on various operating systems, ensuring compatibility for running on local machines.
In the documentation, clearly state that while the tool is fully functional and powerful,
it does not issue certifications
when installed locally due to limitations in the trust model.
SaaS Configuration:
Configure the tool for deployment on a cloud platform, enabling it as a SaaS offering. This setup allows for centralized updates, management, and
certification issuance
.
Ensure the SaaS platform maintains high security and reliability standards, facilitating the tool's ability to issue trusted certifications for Smart Contracts tested through the service.
5. Intersect Collaboration
Formalize an agreement with Intersect for them to offer the tool as a SaaS platform, hosted on cloud infrastructure provided by IOG and IOI.
Outline a process for Intersect to request new developments based on community feedback, with IOG and IOI serving as (preferred) development partners.
Activate a module for Intersect to issue certifications for dApps that meet L1 and L3 testing requirements through their SaaS platform.
6. Community Engagement and Governance
Create a governance model for the project that includes representatives from IOI, the Cardano ecosystem, Intersect, and the broader developer community.
Plan regular community calls, hackathons, and contribution drives to encourage active participation in the tool’s development and maintenance.
7. Documentation
Develop extensive documentation covering the tool's use, extension, and contribution guidelines.
8. Monitoring and Reporting
Implement a system for monitoring the tool’s usage, contribution activity, and overall health of the project.
Provide regular reports to the community on development progress, new features, and usage statistics.
9. New Development Proposals
Model Checker Integration
: Plan to integrate the IOI Model Checker with the property-based testing approach for Level 1 certificates. This will allow formal verification of smart contracts written in Plutus TX, enhancing the tool's capability to ensure the reliability and security of smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain.
Aiken and Plu-TS Native Support:
While the tool currently supports any surface language via UPC, we propose to implement native support for Aiken and Plu-TS if demanded by the community. This would streamline testing processes for developers using these languages.
Marketplace for Modules
: Develop a framework and guidelines for a marketplace where developers can offer additional modules for the tool, thereby extending its functionality. It's crucial that this marketplace maintains the same high quality standards as the main tool to ensure consistency and reliability.
Training and Education
: Offer training sessions and materials for both new users and contributors to build a knowledgeable and engaged community. This initiative will help users understand how to effectively utilize the tool and encourage contributions that drive the tool's development forward.
Conclusion
This handover plan aims to ensure the new IOI (former IOG) Testing Tool becomes a vital, community-driven asset within the ecosystem, with Intersect playing a key role in its future development and certification capabilities. Through open-source collaboration, the tool will continue to evolve, supporting the growth and security of Cardano dApps.",How does the proposed integration of the IOI Model Checker and the expansion of supported Smart Contract languages contribute to enhancing the versatility and effectiveness of the IOG Testing Tool in identifying vulnerabilities?,"The proposed integration of the IOI Model Checker and the expansion of supported Smart Contract languages contribute to enhancing the versatility and effectiveness of the IOG Testing Tool in identifying vulnerabilities in several ways.

        Firstly, the integration of the IOI Model Checker for formal verification alongside property-based testing within the tool creates a dual approach to testing. This dual approach is particularly crucial for testing Smart Contracts with off-chain code, where formal verification alone might not capture all potential issues. By combining these two methods, the tool can provide a more comprehensive coverage for both L1 and L3 certificate testing, thereby increasing its ability to identify vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts.

        Secondly, the expansion of supported Smart Contract languages through UPC and native support for Aiken and Plu-TS enhances the tool's versatility. This expansion allows the tool to support a wider array of Smart Contract languages, which is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in a diverse range of Smart Contracts. By supporting more languages, the tool can be used by a broader range of developers, which can lead to the identification of a wider range of vulnerabilities.

        Lastly, the expansion of supported Smart Contract languages also increases the tool's effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities. By providing native support for Aiken and Plu-TS, the tool can streamline the testing process for developers using these languages. This can lead to more efficient testing, which can increase the likelihood of identifying vulnerabilities. Additionally, the tool's ability to support any surface language via UPC allows it to be used with a wide range of Smart Contracts, which can increase its effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities."

To reduce churn rate, the team should send a user survey to understand the reasons for churn and analyze the answers, complete a website audit (UX, SEO, messaging), update the website with relevant keywords, DApp Store content, and more resources (relevant FAQs, glossary, infographics, videos). The team should also structure a series of masterclasses (pseudo-webinars) and keep release notes on a regular cadence. To drive website traffic, the team should create blog posts for each persona, produce product features videos, and collaborate with nano influencers in the Cardano ecosystem for content.
        In Q2 2024, the content strategy should continue to focus on reducing churn rate and driving website traffic, while also increasing brand awareness. To reduce churn rate, the team should research and produce infographics that can be shared within the community and keep release notes on a regular cadence. To drive website traffic, the team should create Discord stages and Twitter spaces. To increase brand awareness, the team should take part in external Twitter spaces, use social media, research events to take part in, research podcasts to take part in, and collaborate with nano influencers in the Cardano ecosystem for content.
        In Q3 2024, the content strategy should focus on establishing Lace as the distribution channel for XSY Liquidity OS and maintaining social media engagement. To establish Lace as the distribution channel for XSY Liquidity OS, the team should include Lace on XSY website, redo Lace messaging within XSY context, and communicate Lace + DJED integration. To maintain social media engagement, the team should create a social media strategy + calendar for 3 months and create a community strategy + plan for 3 months.
        In Q4 2024, the content strategy should focus on increasing brand awareness and maintaining social media engagement. To increase brand awareness, the team should participate in external podcasts, take part in events, sponsor community events, share the whitepaper and use PR. To maintain social media engagement, the team should keep release notes on a regular cadence and share the whitepaper and use PR.
        Throughout the year, the team should also focus on creating engaging content on social media and in the community, researching and producing infographics, and collaborating with nano influencers in the Cardano ecosystem for content. The team should also create a content strategy planning document to outline the business reason, content, resources, and next steps for each action item. The team should also create a content structure document to outline the tone, audience, and key success metric for each channel. The team should also create an editorial calendar to plan and track the publication date and status of each piece of content."

Summary
During deployment of an update to our Muesli Swap API proxy, to whitelist a new optimised endpoint as requested by the Muesli Swap team, we detected access to the old endpoint had been blocked for our proxy which resulted in Lace users being served old data from the cache.
Timeline
2024-01-11 16:27 UTC
— Muesli Swap team reached on Discord to request we upgrade to a new custom endpoint they’ve deployed, to reduce the demand the Lace proxy is placing on the API. The plan was to limit “access to the [current] endpoint.. … by the end of this month or latest mid February”
2024-01-12 16:21 UTC
— Rhys acknowledged
2024-01-14 13:50 UTC
— Last successful cache update on
https://muesliswap.live-mainnet.eks.lw.iog.io/list?base-policy-id=&base-tokenname=
2024-01-16 10:55 UTC
— A PR with updates to our proxy
2024-01-16 13:38 UTC
— Test deployment to
https://muesliswap.ops-preview-1.eks.lw.iog.io/
(new endpoint works, old one returns 503).
2024-01-17 11:49 UTC
— Gytis says he’s on PTO and to engage Berno instead
2024-01-17 19:37 UTC
— Berno starts the investigation
2024-01-18 12:15 UTC
— Michal pairs with Berno to investigate some more,
2024-01-18 13:20 UTC
— We finally detect that requests from Amazon to
https://api.muesliswap.com/list?base-policy-id=&base-tokenname=
are banned and return 503, and report that to Rhys
2024-01-18 13:59 UTC
— Rhys asks Muesli Swap team to confirm the restriction.
Impact
Token pricing is informational only, however, Lace users were being served stale pricing data up to 5 days old.
Root Causes Analysis
Why did the MS API reject our proxy’s requests?
There’s a limit of 5 requests per hour in place and we exceeded this limit by sending an upstream request
for each
of our user requests.
Why did it only just happen now, despite there being no changes on our side?
Initial hypothesis:
The MS team performed a server update around this time so it’s
likely we ended up exceeding the request limit during the outage, retrying every 1 minute, and have since been fetching at a rate that keeps us on the ban list.
To trigger this behavior, an
anomalous response time of more than 10 s
was needed, which caused a proxy cache lock timeout, and another request before the first one finished. This interfered with their rate limiter which made the 2nd request wait for 60 s, which timed out the second cache lock. This caused many subsequent upstream requests, each failing with a 503. None of those requests were cached, because of the cache lock timeout. A detailed explanation is added to the end of the document.
Why didn’t we detect these rejections?
There was no monitoring in place, of:
either
X-Cache-Status:
— instead of the usual
HIT
it was constantly
UPDATING
,
or of the cache file modification timestamp,
or error logs of the proxy.
Corrective Action Plan
Short term: Adjust our proxy to stop over requesting the data.
Add monitoring to our proxy to be alerted of future request errors. The
GET /health
endpoint will also include
last_cache_hit
timestamp. We will alert once it’s too old.
Detailed technical explanation
MuesliSwap configured a rate limiter of 1 request/minute/IP without
nodelay
and a
burst
of 1, which means:
that you can ~instantly get a response when you request less often than 1 r/m,
for the 2nd request they
will keep you waiting
(i.e. open connection, no read) until that 1 minute since the 1st request passed, and respond then,
for the 3rd request within that minute, they
will respond with a 503
Service Unavailable
Michal Rus
has configured
proxy_cache_lock
which is a lock for an upstream resource. If we’re already waiting for a response, then subsequent requests from our clients will not cause other requests to upstream — instead they will wait for that first response. Which is what we want.
But he also set
proxy_cache_lock_timeout
to only 10 s. This means that this lock has a timeout. If 10 s pass without a response from upstream, it will be automatically unlocked, and another request to upstream will be send (from that 2nd+ request(s) of our clients).
When those upstream requests finally return something (either 200 OK, or 503 (from their rate limiter), or 504 (gateway timeout on our side)),
nothing will be cached
.
So we got into a loop which went like this:
Cache is invalidated (it’s too stale, that’s normal).
We request from upstream, but they unfortunately take more than 10 seconds to respond this time — some anomaly that can happen.
Because of that our
proxy_cache_lock
times out and we issue another request which their rate limiter keeps hanging for 1 minute.
This causes another
proxy_cache_lock
timeout for that 2nd request, so we issue a 3rd.
This 3rd one returns immediately with a 503.
We get a 4th request from our user, which is passed immediately to upstream because all locks are timed out, and 3rd one returned immediately. We get another 503.
Once the 2nd request is unblocked by upstream after 60 s, even if it is a 200 OK, we don’t cache it, because its cache lock timed out too.
Since none of those responses are cached because of the lock timeout, we still serve the
last cached
response to our users which was 200 OK 4 days ago.
At this point we've sent so many requests (that each returned a 503), that the next one we send will be hanging for another 60 s.
Go back to point
c.
The solution is to:
Increase
proxy_cache_lock
timeout to infinity, i.e. never send another request before this one returned.
At the same time control
connect()
and
send()
timeouts (not that important, I kept them at defaults).
But also set the
read()
timeout slightly higher than their rate limiter. This should never matter in normal operation, because we’ll be getting their responses immediately, but just in case (e.g. there are two proxies on the same Amazon IP, so in theory it could matter).",What configuration change to the proxy's cache lock timeout and read timeout could have prevented the loop of repeated requests and 503 errors when accessing the Muesli Swap API?,"To prevent the loop of repeated requests and 503 errors when accessing the Muesli Swap API, the proxy's cache lock timeout should be increased to infinity, i.e. never send another request before this one returned. Additionally, the read() timeout should be set slightly higher than the Muesli Swap API's rate limiter. This should never matter in normal operation, because the proxy will be getting responses immediately, but it provides a safety measure in case of anomalies."

NA - We are considering a long term plan and continuous delivery to achieve feature parity with lace extension.
Phases
(note: there might be only one phase!)
We propose the following phases assuming a small team of 2 engineers. With a bigger team we could progress phase 1 and 2 in parallel. It goes as follows:
Phase 1:
Engine / Low fidelity design
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
In this initial phase, our primary focus is on laying the foundational business logic and abstraction layers essential for the wallet. By starting with a simplified set of features and iterating based on feedback, we aim to deploy an internal build featuring a basic UI for comprehensive testing. On the other hand, we also need to design the latest features which were added to the browser version e.g. Multi-staking. Plus, define market launch and potential partnerships which could increase lace’s userbase.. It is important to note neither multi-chain nor the improvement of the feature releasement impacts our effort. We can progress this phase without depdendnices with those two projects.
In summary, phase 1 will entail engineering effort, design effort and business effort all different tracks moving in parallel.
Scope for this phase
Users can add (create/restore) multiple wallets
Users can manage portfolio
Users can check balance
Users can view transaction history
Users can build transaction
Users can send txs
Users can receive txs
Users can delegate to a stake pool
Users can secure wallet
Users can use basic settings
Users can connect to dapps
Define UX and UI for missing [FOOR, Multi-staking, Multi-sig, etc]
Go to market strategy
Out of Scope for this phase
UI toolkit
High fidelity screen designs and implementation
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
The onboarding flow is almost complete. We need to update based on the latest changes the extension wallet implemented.
Secure wallet: Change passcode; biometrics
Phase 1 is crucial for answering key questions and establishing a solid foundation for future development
Phase 2: High fidelity design
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
For this phase we will focus on improving the UI and overall wallet experience by implementing high fidelity designs. We will also require going through a
user testing exercise
to make sure all the experience plays out nicely. This will require usability testing as we polish the UX/UI, and a invite only beta test within the community, before we launch, to test the overall experience.
Scope for this phase
UI toolkit / design system -
Revamp phase 1 screens

Phase 3: Feature
parity
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
Considering a basic functionality wallet will not make major difference in the market, for this phase we will aim at feature parity depending on the progress we have made on the improvement of the release process for both extension and mobile.
Scope for this phase
Notifications screen
Address book

Jira Epic(s):
DESIRED OUTCOMES
This is a success if and only if:
User can see the current Cardano network’s state regarding mempool capacity
Wallets only have to transmit each transaction once even if the rejection is due to mempool exceeding capacity
Problem Statement
Problem #1
: the Lace user is sending a Tx and not getting it confirmed in long time, or just longer than expected without knowing what's going on/what's the issue, talking specifically about the blockchain congestion scenario.
Problem #2
: The other issue this features covers is queuing Tx in our backend, instead of having the client to retry submissions or error back to the user
High-level scope
Phase 1:
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
once Lace mempool is full, a newly submitted transaction can not get into it, hence, the user sees the hanging spinner constantly without any indication or guaranty that the user transaction will be submitted. Increasing the Lace node mempool size ensures that there is enough space to fit a new transaction into the mempool immediately, hence, the user will see the “Submitted” transaction status in Lace, assuring that their transaction is submitted.
Scope for this phase
SRE
:
Increase node mempool size:
https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/3343/files#diff-0f34d8b804076e6d3b92b60639212c401501d48efd87e3f2b1a394e12b7f8831R269-R273
Set up mempool monitoring/alerts
BE
:
Add mempool monitoring Prometheus metric (days of work)
implementation with ogmios
https://ogmios.dev/mini-protocols/local-tx-monitor/
Delete RabbitMq (just clean-up work) (days of work)
QA:
we can set up the following test:
test #1: create a script to submit a lot of transactions to get the lace node mempool full to see what happens and if the mempool alerts are triggered
Out of Scope for this phase
developing this feature
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
this work is highly dependent on SRE
Phase 2: Lace user can see anticipated time to adopt a transaction on Cardano blockchain
Lace user is ensured that their submitted transaction doesn’t get rejected due to network load/congestion
Client sends Tx only once, no matter what is congestion/overload on the backend or blockchain side
Increase mempool size
of our mainnet node
https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/3343/files#diff-0f34d8b804076e6d3b92b60639212c401501d48efd87e3f2b1a394e12b7f8831R269-R273
Lace user can see anticipated time to adopt a transaction on Cardano blockchain as if it is sent now
The API will need to serve the current state of the Cardano network mempool for display in Lace
Average time to adoption for transactions in real time
A visual component in Lace that displays the expected time to adoption in the send screen
Proposal to use user-friendly colors with time ranges (less than 20 sec, less than 2 min, etc)
Lace user is ensured that their submitted transaction doesn’t get rejected due to network load/congestion
Client sends Tx only once, no matter what is congestion/overload on the backend or blockchain side
Increase mempool size
of our mainnet node
https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/3343/files#diff-0f34d8b804076e6d3b92b60639212c401501d48efd87e3f2b1a394e12b7f8831R269-R273
Lace DevOps can see Lace node mempool metric and alerts
Set up mempool monitoring (new metric and alert)
Lace system (backend and infra) can withstand XX transaction load per second
Are all backend components scaled enough to stand a bull run?
ICE
Impact: 5/6
This feature affects the user satisfaction in scenarios of high load of Cardano. It’s one more datapoint in the overall UX of the user. B
By itself it won’t likely change overall UX of the user, but it accounts as one more datapoint to take into account.
It can provide a differentiation compared to other wallets, a subtle difference that users appreciate
Confidence: 8/9 (proposed)
According to last bull run we’re confident this scenario impacts users UX.

1. Trustless transaction construction using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet,"""Explain how trustless transaction construction is achieved using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet.""","Trustless transaction construction using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet is achieved through the following steps:

        1. Key Generation: The Lace Light Wallet generates a new key pair for each transaction, ensuring that the user's private key is never exposed.

        2. Transaction Creation: The user creates a transaction by specifying the recipient's address and the amount to be transferred. The transaction is then signed using the user's private key.

        3. Mithril Integration: Mithril is a lightweight, secure, and decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data to smart contracts. In the context of Lace Light Wallet, Mithril is used to verify the transaction details, such as the recipient's address and the transaction amount, before the transaction is broadcast to the network.

        4. Transaction Verification: Mithril verifies the transaction details by querying multiple data sources and cross-referencing the information. Once the transaction details have been verified, Mithril generates a proof-of-data (PoD) that is attached to the transaction.

        5. Transaction Broadcast: The transaction, along with the PoD, is then broadcast to the network. The network nodes use the PoD to verify the transaction details, ensuring that the transaction is valid and trustworthy.

        6. Transaction Confirmation: Once the transaction has been verified by the network nodes, it is added to the blockchain and considered confirmed.

        By using Mithril for trustless transaction construction, Lace Light Wallet ensures that all transactions are secure, verifiable, and tamper-proof, providing users with a high level of trust and confidence in the transaction process."

"In the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem, users face significant challenges in managing and interacting with digital assets in a secure, intuitive, and efficient manner.
Despite the proliferation of Web3 wallets, many users, especially those new to blockchain technology, struggle with complexities around wallet setup, security measures, and the nuanced understanding required to safely navigate decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and cross-chain transactions.
Additionally, the existing solutions often fail to offer a seamless integration with a wide range of blockchain networks,
leading to a fragmented user experience and hindering broader adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other Web3 applications.
Our objective is to develop a mobile Web3 wallet that addresses these challenges by offering a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable platform. This wallet will empower both novice and experienced users to manage their digital assets effortlessly, engage with dApps across different blockchains, and participate in the digital economy with confidence. By doing so, we aim to accelerate the adoption of Web3 technologies and foster a more inclusive and accessible decentralized ecosystem.
Why mobile
Where do wallets go? In your pocket!
Accessibility and Convenience:
Most people carry their smartphones everywhere, making mobile wallets readily accessible for everyday use.
Integration with Mobile Apps:
Easy integration with existing mobile apps and potential expansion into mobile-based decentralized applications (dApps).
Frictionless User Experience:
Leverage existing smartphone features like biometric authentication and camera scanning for convenient transactions.
Wider Audience Reach:
May attract a larger user base due to mobile's broader accessibility compared to desktop computers.trends
Overall Users:
Active Wallets:
As of October 2023, there are around 80 million unique active wallets interacting with DeFi protocols, indicating potential user numbers for broader Web3 applications
Demographics:
Early adopters tend to be young (25-34 years old), tech-savvy, and interested in finance and investing
Market movement
Upcoming Bitcoin Halving (April 2024):
Reduces the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation by 50%, potentially
decreasing supply and increasing demand
. Historically, halvings have been followed by price increases. Looking at past halvings, we see significant price increases following the events:
1st Halving (Nov 2012):
Price went from ~$12 to ~$1,000 within a year.
2nd Halving (Jul 2016):
Price initially dipped but reached ~$2,550 by July 2017.
3rd Halving (May 2020):
Price rose from ~$9,734 to ~$67,549 within a year.
SEC ETF Approval:
Compared to directly buying and holding Bitcoin, ETFs offer a familiar and regulated investment vehicle for institutions. This simplifies access, reduces administrative burdens, and potentially enhances perceived security due to regulatory oversight. Institutions often seek portfolio diversification, and Bitcoin, despite its volatility, can offer unique characteristics that complement traditional assets. An ETF allows them to gain exposure to this asset class in a measured and controlled manner, potentially hedging against other risks.
A US-approved ETF could significantly legitimize Bitcoin in the eyes of institutional investors. It would signal regulatory acceptance and potentially clarify regulatory ambiguities, making it more comfortable for institutions to invest.
Development of the blockchain technology
Faster Transactions and Improved Scalability: Blockchain networks like Ethereum are implementing solutions like sharding and rollups to increase transaction speed and handle more users, addressing a major hurdle for wider adoption. Faster and cheaper transactions make cryptocurrencies more practical for everyday use, potentially driving demand.
Interoperability: Projects are focusing on creating bridges and protocols that allow seamless interaction between different blockchains, facilitating easier movement of assets and unlocking new use cases. Increased interoperability breaks down siloed ecosystems and encourages broader participation.
Privacy-Focused Solutions: Growing concerns about data privacy are leading to the development of privacy-focused blockchains and protocols. These solutions cater to users who prioritize anonymity and control over their data, potentially attracting new user segments.
Yield Farming and Earning Opportunities: Some DeFi protocols offer attractive returns through ""yield farming,"" where users stake their assets to earn rewards. While volatile and risky, it can incentivize new participants and increase liquidity in the DeFi ecosystem.
Of course past performance is not indicative of future results. Price increase is caused by multiple factors. Additionally, the market dynamics constantly evolve, making direct comparisons challenging.

Revenue models
Besides the well-known transactional type of revenue model [charging a fee for swapping and FOOR], here is a proposals for subscription based plans:
Exclusive access to DeFi services and Drops / Become go-to DeFi wallet for new comers
Offer preferential rates and early access to DeFi services and drops exclusively through lace [Play full IOG product ecosystem approach]
Freemium with in-app purchases and subscriptions
Blizzard drop
XSY token early access
Integration with DJED and preferential rates after X amount
Preferential access to a Dapp / Partnership with Dapps which are easy access within lace
Potential for integrating gamified elements like rewards, badges, and leaderboards into DeFi activities (staking, liquidity provision) and NFT interactions (collecting, trading).
The challenge here is balancing gamification with responsible financial practices and avoiding accusations of gambling or manipulation / Becoming a broker of securities
Advanced Security and Privacy Services
Offer advanced security features beyond basic encryption, such as:
Multi-party computation (MPC) for key management.
Zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced transaction privacy.
Secure enclaves for hardware-based key isolation.
Tax tool: Advance reporting VS basic reporting
Notification security service - Monitor tx activity and potential risks
Potential revenue stream by tiered subscriptions with increasing levels of security features.
Insurance against wallet hacks or theft.
Additional storage space for sensitive data.
Looking to engage with to the more security-conscious users and institutions.
The challenge here is balancing complex security features with user-friendliness, and convincing users of the value proposition and justifying premium pricing.
DeFi Aggregator and Portfolio Management Tool
[Could be implemented along with proposal #1]
Offer a comprehensive DeFi aggregator that simplifies access and management of various DeFi protocols within the Cardano ecosystem. We could add value by offering:
Create algorithms to automatically allocate user funds across different DeFi protocols for optimal returns [Wallstreet tech meets web3] - Automated yield optimization
Provide detailed insights into user holdings, returns, and risk exposure across various DeFi activities.
Allow users to personalize their DeFi exposure based on individual risk tolerance and goals - Customizable portfolio strategy
Potential revenue streams:
Subscription fees for access to premium features and automated strategies.
Performance-based fees for successful yield optimization outcomes.
Partnerships with DeFi protocols for referral fees or integration deals.
In which cases do I need to get a broker license?
What type of services can we take from banking digital experiences which could become premium features?
What should we launch to the market?
Considering the competitor's landscape, lace mobile wallet needs to offer a key differentiator
Hypothesis: Users do not get married with wallets. The cost of creating one is zero. In the custodial space, if you already have a favorite wallet, you will stay with that one. If a new wallet comes with a different feature, then you can create a new wallet there and give it a test. If you are concern with security, you will get yourself a hardware wallet.
So the question remains, what would make a user switch wallets? [Topic for user research]
In that sense, this puts us in a difficult situation:

What do we do with a Wallet in the real world?
How do we plan to win the market?
Cardano current users VS web3 non-cardano users VS new web3 users?
Do we want to compete for technical users attention from the get go?
For both Cardano and new users, let’s leverage DJED into the mobile wallet as a way into lace.

Defi Aggregator and portfolio manager
A DeFi aggregator acts like a one-stop shop for various decentralized finance (DeFi) services. It essentially simplifies the complex DeFi ecosystem by bringing different functionalities together in one place. Here's a breakdown of what a DeFi aggregator does:
Combines services:
DeFi consists of numerous scattered protocols spread across different blockchains. DeFi aggregators bring together these services, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, yield farming, decentralized insurance, and liquidity pools.
Optimizes transactions:
By analyzing various DeFi platforms, aggregators aim to find the best possible deals for users. This could involve searching for the most favorable exchange rates for token swaps or identifying the lending services offering the highest yields.
Simplifies user experience:
Instead of manually searching through different DeFi protocols, users can leverage a DeFi aggregator's interface to access various services and execute transactions efficiently.
Automates tasks:
Certain DeFi aggregators, also known as yield aggregators, can automate specific tasks like yield farming. This involves automatically moving crypto assets between different DeFi protocols to maximize returns.
In simpler terms, DeFi aggregators function like search engines for DeFi services. They streamline the process for users by offering:
Centralized access:
Aggregators provide a single platform to access various DeFi functionalities.
Price comparison:
They search for the best deals across different DeFi protocols.
Automated transactions:
They can automate specific DeFi tasks for users.
While DeFi aggregators offer convenience, it’s important to highlight:
They are not without risks:
Like any DeFi interaction, there are inherent risks involved, such as smart contract vulnerabilities and potential scams.
Users should do their own research:
It's crucial to understand the underlying DeFi protocols before using an aggregator
[PAINT POINT FROM USERS]
Overall, DeFi aggregators play a significant role in making DeFi more accessible and user-friendly. They offer a simplified way to interact with various DeFi services, potentially saving time and effort for users.

ANNEX
Trends that can potentially increase web3 consumption
Cryptocurrency:
Over 400 million people globally own cryptocurrency, representing approximately 5% of the world's population.
Bitcoin remains the most widely held cryptocurrency, but other tokens like Ethereum and Solana are gaining traction.
Decentralized Finance (DeFi):
The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols peaked at over $400 billion in November 2021, but has since fluctuated around $100 billion
Lending and borrowing remain the most popular DeFi activities, although other functionalities like liquidity mining and decentralized exchanges are growing.
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):
NFT sales reached over $25 billion in the first half of 2022, showcasing their growing popularity
Art and collectibles are the most common NFT use cases, but applications in gaming, music, and other sectors are emerging.
Metaverse:
User numbers in major metaverse platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox are still relatively low, but growing steadily.
Gaming and virtual land ownership are the primary attractions currently, but the metaverse has the potential for diverse applications in the future.","How can the development of a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable mobile Web3 wallet contribute to the acceleration of decentralized finance technologies and non-fungible token adoption, while addressing challenges faced by users in managing and interacting with digital assets across different blockchain networks?","The development of a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable mobile Web3 wallet can significantly contribute to the acceleration of decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies and non-fungible token (NFT) adoption. This wallet aims to address the challenges users face in managing and interacting with digital assets across different blockchain networks.

        Firstly, the wallet's user-friendly design can onboard more users to the Web3 ecosystem, including those who are new to blockchain technology. By simplifying the process of setting up a wallet, managing assets, and engaging with decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and cross-chain transactions, the wallet can lower the barriers to entry and encourage broader adoption.

        Secondly, the wallet's focus on security can instill confidence in users when managing their digital assets. By offering advanced security features, users can better protect their assets from potential threats, reducing the perceived risks associated with decentralized technologies.

        Thirdly, the wallet's interoperability can provide a seamless user experience by integrating with a wide range of blockchain networks. This integration can help users navigate the fragmented landscape of decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens, enabling them to manage their assets and engage with various dApps more efficiently.

        In summary, the development of a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable mobile Web3 wallet can contribute to the acceleration of decentralized finance technologies and non-fungible token adoption by addressing the challenges users face in managing and interacting with digital assets across different blockchain networks. By simplifying the user experience, enhancing security, and promoting interoperability, the wallet can attract a larger user base, foster trust, and encourage broader adoption of decentralized technologies."

User Journey: End user",What are the key steps and automated checks that a DApp developer must complete in order to register their DApp on the Cardano blockchain and have it listed in the DApp store?,"The key steps and automated checks that a DApp developer must complete in order to register their DApp on the Cardano blockchain and have it listed in the DApp store are as follows:

        1. Prepare the DApp's data in the form of a JSON file according to CIP-72, including project name, link, company name, company email, company website, logo, categories, screenshots, social, short description, and long description.
        2. Upload the JSON file with the DApp's data somewhere on the Internet.
        3. Register the DApp on the Cardano blockchain by constructing a DApp registration transaction with the link/URL for the JSON file with the DApp's data and submitting it to the blockchain.
        4. The Cardano blockchain records the DApp registration transaction, making the data open to everyone.
        5. The DApp store listens to any changes on the Cardano blockchain and pulls the DApp registration transactions from it, which have a specific identification key to distinguish the DApp registration transactions from the other transaction types.
        6. The DApp store performs an automated check/validation of the DApp registration, including a CIP-72 specification check/verification, profanity check, and security check.
        7. If the automated check/validation passes, the DApp store sends an email with the Intellectual Property license, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy to the DApp developer.
        8. The DApp developer reviews the email with the Intellectual Property license, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy and agrees to them by sending a Yes.
        9. The DApp is then shown in the DApp store with the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy.

        If the automated check/validation fails, the DApp developer can check the errors on the ""Check DApp registration"" page and create a new, fixed DApp registration. The DApp store administrator will then review the new DApp registration to ensure it satisfies the Terms of Use. If the manual content moderation fails, the DApp developer will be notified and given the opportunity to fix the issues. If the DApp developer declines or fails to respond to the Intellectual Property license, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy, the DApp will not be listed in the DApp store."

Issue
: because dappstore scope started as a 100% stand-alone app, the file contains elements from a separated
UI toolkit [link]
. But it was decided to use the
original lace ui toolkit [link]
at the frontend. Since the figma component reference it’s used for QA, it may be required to re-link these components into the original toolkit, adjusting the design file as necessary
Disclaimer
:
All copy is attached using
dittowords [link]
, any swap of components (instead of just the style) will required a re-link of that as well.
The designs uses the responsiveness figma plugin, being required to be adjusted respecting the rules of this plugin (like editing each breakpoint size component, for ex).

Daniel Smith",How should the DApp store frontend QA consider the MVP prototype's animations and look-and-feel baseline when addressing the re-linking of components from a separate UI toolkit to the original lace UI toolkit in the design file?,"The DApp store frontend QA should consider the MVP prototype's animations and look-and-feel baseline when addressing the re-linking of components from a separate UI toolkit to the original lace UI toolkit in the design file by ensuring that the responsiveness figma plugin rules are followed, the design file is adjusted as necessary, and the dittowords components are re-linked if any swap of components is made. The QA should also ensure that the design file uses the original lace UI toolkit components and that the design file is updated with any exclusive dappstore component added to the Lace UI toolkit.

DApp Explorer
seems to be the most voted name for the DApp Store.
We are also suggesting ‘
Lace DApp Explorer
’ to differentiate the brand.
Due diligence
Dapp Radar has a component called ‘Explorer’ and it’s branded as
Dapp Radar Explorer
to mitigate the above we can use ‘Lace DApp Explorer’ (exact spelling).
Next action points
ask our Legal department to perform due diligence for the names
Lace DApp Explorer
and
DApp Explorer -
the DApp Explorer will live on the
lace.io
domain and it’s sub-product of Lace

X xx","What is the most preferred name for the DApp store, considering the results from both rounds of voting and the need to differentiate the brand?","The most preferred name for the DApp store, considering the results from both rounds of voting and the need to differentiate the brand, is 'Lace DApp Explorer'. This name was suggested to differentiate the brand from 'DApp Explorer', which was the most voted name in round 2, and to mitigate the risk of similar products such as 'Dapp Radar Explorer'. The name 'Lace DApp Explorer' is a descriptive name that emphasizes the exploration of DApps and includes the brand name 'Lace'. It will live on the 'lace.io' domain and is a sub-product of Lace."

Structure a series of masterclasses (pseudo-webinars)
The hypothesis is that more people would onboard and stay in Lace if they had enough learning materials to help them start this Web3 journey.
Mostly suited for new-to-crypto audience, the format simplifies Web3 content and abstract the jargon as much as possible.
Analysing the uninstallation survey data - 9.15% respondents mentioned they don’t know where to start.
Style
: 10 min Masterclass webinar with live demonstrations in preproduction or preview testing environments
4-5 Masterclasses:
each masterclass has a topic (Installation - onboarding, Using, New features)
Cadence
: every 2 weeks
Audience:
new-to-crypto
set up a wallet and onboarding (Lace onboarding + wallet recovery)
setting up multiple wallets and accounts
simple transactions (send, receive, buy/withdraw)
buying/ selling NFTs
create a handle (ADA Handle)
staking + multi-delegation
managing contacts and understanding how to use handles
using a DEX

Add links to guidelines, glossaries, or any other resource you need.","How can a content strategy roadmap with goals focused on reducing churn rate, driving website traffic, increasing brand awareness, establishing Lace as the distribution channel for XSY Liquidity OS, and maintaining social media engagement be implemented in the four quarters of 2024?","In Q1 2024, the content strategy roadmap should focus on reducing churn rate and driving website traffic. To reduce churn rate, the team should send a user survey to understand the reasons for churn and analyze the answers, complete a website audit (UX, SEO, messaging), update the website with relevant keywords, DApp Store content, and more resources (relevant FAQs, glossary, infographics, videos). The team should also structure a series of masterclasses (pseudo-webinars) and keep release notes on a regular cadence. To drive website traffic, the team should create blog posts for each persona, produce product features videos, and collaborate with nano influencers in the Cardano ecosystem.
        In Q2 2024, the focus should shift to increasing brand awareness and driving website traffic. The team should take part in external Twitter spaces, use social media, research events and podcasts to take part in, and work on the whitepaper. The team should also sponsor community events and share the whitepaper and use PR.
        In Q3 2024, the team should focus on establishing Lace as the distribution channel for XSY Liquidity OS. The team should include Lace on XSY website, redo Lace messaging within XSY context, and communicate Lace + DJED integration.
        In Q4 2024, the team should maintain social media engagement and continue to drive website traffic. The team should create a social media strategy + calendar for 3 months and create a community strategy + plan for 3 months. The team should also continue to produce blog posts, product features videos, and collaborate with nano influencers in the Cardano ecosystem.
        Throughout the year, the team should prioritize user behavior (time on page, time on video, % watched video, pages, sessions), impressions & CTRs, content shares & backlinks, keyword ranking, and lead generation as success metrics. The team should also keep release notes on a regular cadence and use social media to engage with the community."

are there any limitations, known risks, etc?","Given the new functionalities and changes in Nami version 3.7.0, what should users expect in terms of new features, bug fixes, and known issues as highlighted in the release notes and documentation?","Users should expect new functionalities such as content updates to reflect IOG as new maintainers, delegation can now be made to any nominated pool, opt-in analytics, and the removal of the legacy testnet option. Additionally, users should expect bug fixes and improvements in existing functionalities as a result of manual regression testing and feature completion validation. However, there may be known issues such as major bugs that are not impacting the release but are not Nami bugs, and a rollback plan is in place if anything goes wrong during deployment or post-release.

Summary
During deployment of an update to our Muesli Swap API proxy, to whitelist a new optimised endpoint as requested by the Muesli Swap team, we detected access to the old endpoint had been blocked for our proxy which resulted in Lace users being served old data from the cache.
Timeline
2024-01-11 16:27 UTC
— Muesli Swap team reached on Discord to request we upgrade to a new custom endpoint they’ve deployed, to reduce the demand the Lace proxy is placing on the API. The plan was to limit “access to the [current] endpoint.. … by the end of this month or latest mid February”
2024-01-12 16:21 UTC

2024-01-17 11:49 UTC
— Gytis says he’s on PTO and to engage Berno instead
2024-01-17 19:37 UTC
— Berno starts the investigation
2024-01-18 12:15 UTC
— Michal pairs with Berno to investigate some more,
2024-01-18 13:20 UTC
— We finally detect that requests from Amazon to
https://api.muesliswap.com/list?base-policy-id=&base-tokenname=
are banned and return 503, and report that to Rhys
2024-01-18 13:59 UTC
— Rhys asks Muesli Swap team to confirm the restriction.
Impact
Token pricing is informational only, however, Lace users were being served stale pricing data up to 5 days old.
Root Causes Analysis
Why did the MS API reject our proxy’s requests?
There’s a limit of 5 requests per hour in place and we exceeded this limit by sending an upstream request
for each
of our user requests.
Why did it only just happen now, despite there being no changes on our side?
Initial hypothesis:
The MS team performed a server update around this time so it’s
likely we ended up exceeding the request limit during the outage, retrying every 1 minute, and have since been fetching at a rate that keeps us on the ban list.
To trigger this behavior, an
anomalous response time of more than 10 s
was needed, which caused a proxy cache lock timeout, and another request before the first one finished. This interfered with their rate limiter which made the 2nd request wait for 60 s, which timed out the second cache lock. This caused many subsequent upstream requests, each failing with a 503. None of those requests were cached, because of the cache lock timeout. A detailed explanation is added to the end of the document.
Why didn’t we detect these rejections?
There was no monitoring in place, of:
either
X-Cache-Status:
— instead of the usual
HIT
it was constantly
UPDATING
,
or of the cache file modification timestamp,
or error logs of the proxy.
Corrective Action Plan
Short term: Adjust our proxy to stop over requesting the data.
Add monitoring to our proxy to be alerted of future request errors. The
GET /health
endpoint will also include
last_cache_hit
timestamp. We will alert once it’s too old.
Detailed technical explanation
MuesliSwap configured a rate limiter of 1 request/minute/IP without
nodelay
and a
burst
of 1, which means:
that you can ~instantly get a response when you request less often than 1 r/m,
for the 2nd request they
will keep you waiting
(i.e. open connection, no read) until that 1 minute since the 1st request passed, and respond then,
for the 3rd request within that minute, they
will respond with a 503
Service Unavailable
Michal Rus
has configured
proxy_cache_lock
which is a lock for an upstream resource. If we’re already waiting for a response, then subsequent requests from our clients will not cause other requests to upstream — instead they will wait for that first response. Which is what we want.
But he also set
proxy_cache_lock_timeout
to only 10 s. This means that this lock has a timeout. If 10 s pass without a response from upstream, it will be automatically unlocked, and another request to upstream will be send (from that 2nd+ request(s) of our clients).
When those upstream requests finally return something (either 200 OK, or 503 (from their rate limiter), or 504 (gateway timeout on our side)),
nothing will be cached
.
So we got into a loop which went like this:
Cache is invalidated (it’s too stale, that’s normal).
We request from upstream, but they unfortunately take more than 10 seconds to respond this time — some anomaly that can happen.
Because of that our
proxy_cache_lock
times out and we issue another request which their rate limiter keeps hanging for 1 minute.
This causes another
proxy_cache_lock
timeout for that 2nd request, so we issue a 3rd.
This 3rd one returns immediately with a 503.
We get a 4th request from our user, which is passed immediately to upstream because all locks are timed out, and 3rd one returned immediately. We get another 503.
Once the 2nd request is unblocked by upstream after 60 s, even if it is a 200 OK, we don’t cache it, because its cache lock timed out too.
Since none of those responses are cached because of the lock timeout, we still serve the
last cached
response to our users which was 200 OK 4 days ago.
At this point we've sent so many requests (that each returned a 503), that the next one we send will be hanging for another 60 s.
Go back to point
c.
The solution is to:
Increase
proxy_cache_lock
timeout to infinity, i.e. never send another request before this one returned.
At the same time control
connect()
and
send()
timeouts (not that important, I kept them at defaults).
But also set the
read()
timeout slightly higher than their rate limiter. This should never matter in normal operation, because we’ll be getting their responses immediately, but just in case (e.g. there are two proxies on the same Amazon IP, so in theory it could matter).",What configuration change to the proxy's cache lock timeout and read timeout could have prevented the loop of repeated requests and 503 errors when accessing the Muesli Swap API?,"To prevent the loop of repeated requests and 503 errors when accessing the Muesli Swap API, the proxy's cache lock timeout should be increased to infinity, i.e. never send another request before this one returned. Additionally, the read() timeout should be set slightly higher than the Muesli Swap API's rate limiter. This should never matter in normal operation, because the proxy will be getting responses immediately, but it provides a safety measure in case of anomalies."

Phases
(note: there might be only one phase!)
We propose the following phases assuming a small team of 2 engineers. With a bigger team we could progress phase 1 and 2 in parallel. It goes as follows:
Phase 1:
Engine / Low fidelity design
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
In this initial phase, our primary focus is on laying the foundational business logic and abstraction layers essential for the wallet. By starting with a simplified set of features and iterating based on feedback, we aim to deploy an internal build featuring a basic UI for comprehensive testing. On the other hand, we also need to design the latest features which were added to the browser version e.g. Multi-staking. Plus, define market launch and potential partnerships which could increase lace’s userbase.. It is important to note neither multi-chain nor the improvement of the feature releasement impacts our effort. We can progress this phase without depdendnices with those two projects.
In summary, phase 1 will entail engineering effort, design effort and business effort all different tracks moving in parallel.
Scope for this phase
Users can add (create/restore) multiple wallets
Users can manage portfolio
Users can check balance
Users can view transaction history
Users can build transaction
Users can send txs
Users can receive txs
Users can delegate to a stake pool
Users can secure wallet
Users can use basic settings
Users can connect to dapps
Define UX and UI for missing [FOOR, Multi-staking, Multi-sig, etc]
Go to market strategy
Out of Scope for this phase
UI toolkit
High fidelity screen designs and implementation
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
The onboarding flow is almost complete. We need to update based on the latest changes the extension wallet implemented.
Secure wallet: Change passcode; biometrics
Phase 1 is crucial for answering key questions and establishing a solid foundation for future development
Phase 2: High fidelity design
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
For this phase we will focus on improving the UI and overall wallet experience by implementing high fidelity designs. We will also require going through a
user testing exercise
to make sure all the experience plays out nicely. This will require usability testing as we polish the UX/UI, and a invite only beta test within the community, before we launch, to test the overall experience.
Scope for this phase
UI toolkit / design system -
Revamp phase 1 screens

Phase 3: Feature
parity
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
Considering a basic functionality wallet will not make major difference in the market, for this phase we will aim at feature parity depending on the progress we have made on the improvement of the release process for both extension and mobile.

Jira Epic(s):
DESIRED OUTCOMES
This is a success if and only if:
User can see the current Cardano network’s state regarding mempool capacity
Wallets only have to transmit each transaction once even if the rejection is due to mempool exceeding capacity
Problem Statement
Problem #1
: the Lace user is sending a Tx and not getting it confirmed in long time, or just longer than expected without knowing what's going on/what's the issue, talking specifically about the blockchain congestion scenario.
Problem #2
: The other issue this features covers is queuing Tx in our backend, instead of having the client to retry submissions or error back to the user
High-level scope
Phase 1:
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
once Lace mempool is full, a newly submitted transaction can not get into it, hence, the user sees the hanging spinner constantly without any indication or guaranty that the user transaction will be submitted. Increasing the Lace node mempool size ensures that there is enough space to fit a new transaction into the mempool immediately, hence, the user will see the “Submitted” transaction status in Lace, assuring that their transaction is submitted.
Scope for this phase
SRE
:
Increase node mempool size:
https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/3343/files#diff-0f34d8b804076e6d3b92b60639212c401501d48efd87e3f2b1a394e12b7f8831R269-R273
Set up mempool monitoring/alerts
BE
:
Add mempool monitoring Prometheus metric (days of work)
implementation with ogmios
https://ogmios.dev/mini-protocols/local-tx-monitor/
Delete RabbitMq (just clean-up work) (days of work)
QA:
we can set up the following test:
test #1: create a script to submit a lot of transactions to get the lace node mempool full to see what happens and if the mempool alerts are triggered
Out of Scope for this phase
developing this feature
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
this work is highly dependent on SRE
Phase 2: Lace user can see anticipated time to adopt a transaction on Cardano blockchain
Lace user is ensured that their submitted transaction doesn’t get rejected due to network load/congestion
Client sends Tx only once, no matter what is congestion/overload on the backend or blockchain side
Increase mempool size
of our mainnet node
https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/3343/files#diff-0f34d8b804076e6d3b92b60639212c401501d48efd87e3f2b1a394e12b7f8831R269-R273
Lace user can see anticipated time to adopt a transaction on Cardano blockchain as if it is sent now
The API will need to serve the current state of the Cardano network mempool for display in Lace
Average time to adoption for transactions in real time
A visual component in Lace that displays the expected time to adoption in the send screen
Proposal to use user-friendly colors with time ranges (less than 20 sec, less than 2 min, etc)
Lace user is ensured that their submitted transaction doesn’t get rejected due to network load/congestion
Client sends Tx only once, no matter what is congestion/overload on the backend or blockchain side

Lace DevOps can see Lace node mempool metric and alerts
Set up mempool monitoring (new metric and alert)
Lace system (backend and infra) can withstand XX transaction load per second
Are all backend components scaled enough to stand a bull run?
ICE
Impact: 5/6
This feature affects the user satisfaction in scenarios of high load of Cardano. It’s one more datapoint in the overall UX of the user. B
By itself it won’t likely change overall UX of the user, but it accounts as one more datapoint to take into account.
It can provide a differentiation compared to other wallets, a subtle difference that users appreciate
Confidence: 8/9 (proposed)
According to last bull run we’re confident this scenario impacts users UX.

1. Trustless transaction construction using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet,"""Explain how trustless transaction construction is achieved using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet.""","Trustless transaction construction using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet is achieved through the use of a decentralized identifier (DID) and verifiable credentials (VCs). The DID is a unique identifier that is controlled by the user and is used to create and sign transactions. The VCs are digital credentials that are issued by trusted entities and can be used to prove the user's identity or ownership of assets.

        In the Lace Light Wallet, Mithril is used to create and manage the user's DID and VCs. Mithril is a decentralized identity and access management system that is built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create and manage their own DIDs and VCs, and to use them to securely interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and services.

        When a user wants to construct a trustless transaction, they use their DID to create a new transaction and then attach the relevant VCs to prove their identity or ownership of assets. The transaction is then broadcast to the Ethereum network, where it is verified and processed by the nodes.

        Because the transaction is signed using the user's DID, it is considered trustless, as there is no need for a third-party to verify the user's identity or ownership of assets. This allows for secure and decentralized peer-to-peer transactions, without the need for intermediaries.

        In summary, trustless transaction construction using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet is achieved through the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) which allows users to create and sign transactions securely and without the need for intermediaries."

"In the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem, users face significant challenges in managing and interacting with digital assets in a secure, intuitive, and efficient manner.
Despite the proliferation of Web3 wallets, many users, especially those new to blockchain technology, struggle with complexities around wallet setup, security measures, and the nuanced understanding required to safely navigate decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and cross-chain transactions.
Additionally, the existing solutions often fail to offer a seamless integration with a wide range of blockchain networks,
leading to a fragmented user experience and hindering broader adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other Web3 applications.
Our objective is to develop a mobile Web3 wallet that addresses these challenges by offering a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable platform. This wallet will empower both novice and experienced users to manage their digital assets effortlessly, engage with dApps across different blockchains, and participate in the digital economy with confidence. By doing so, we aim to accelerate the adoption of Web3 technologies and foster a more inclusive and accessible decentralized ecosystem.
Why mobile
Where do wallets go? In your pocket!
Accessibility and Convenience:
Most people carry their smartphones everywhere, making mobile wallets readily accessible for everyday use.
Integration with Mobile Apps:
Easy integration with existing mobile apps and potential expansion into mobile-based decentralized applications (dApps).
Frictionless User Experience:
Leverage existing smartphone features like biometric authentication and camera scanning for convenient transactions.
Wider Audience Reach:
May attract a larger user base due to mobile's broader accessibility compared to desktop computers.trends
Overall Users:
Active Wallets:
As of October 2023, there are around 80 million unique active wallets interacting with DeFi protocols, indicating potential user numbers for broader Web3 applications
Demographics:
Early adopters tend to be young (25-34 years old), tech-savvy, and interested in finance and investing
Market movement
Upcoming Bitcoin Halving (April 2024):
Reduces the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation by 50%, potentially
decreasing supply and increasing demand
. Historically, halvings have been followed by price increases. Looking at past halvings, we see significant price increases following the events:
1st Halving (Nov 2012):
Price went from ~$12 to ~$1,000 within a year.
2nd Halving (Jul 2016):
Price initially dipped but reached ~$2,550 by July 2017.
3rd Halving (May 2020):
Price rose from ~$9,734 to ~$67,549 within a year.
SEC ETF Approval:
Compared to directly buying and holding Bitcoin, ETFs offer a familiar and regulated investment vehicle for institutions. This simplifies access, reduces administrative burdens, and potentially enhances perceived security due to regulatory oversight. Institutions often seek portfolio diversification, and Bitcoin, despite its volatility, can offer unique characteristics that complement traditional assets. An ETF allows them to gain exposure to this asset class in a measured and controlled manner, potentially hedging against other risks.
A US-approved ETF could significantly legitimize Bitcoin in the eyes of institutional investors. It would signal regulatory acceptance and potentially clarify regulatory ambiguities, making it more comfortable for institutions to invest.
Development of the blockchain technology
Faster Transactions and Improved Scalability: Blockchain networks like Ethereum are implementing solutions like sharding and rollups to increase transaction speed and handle more users, addressing a major hurdle for wider adoption. Faster and cheaper transactions make cryptocurrencies more practical for everyday use, potentially driving demand.
Interoperability: Projects are focusing on creating bridges and protocols that allow seamless interaction between different blockchains, facilitating easier movement of assets and unlocking new use cases. Increased interoperability breaks down siloed ecosystems and encourages broader participation.
Privacy-Focused Solutions: Growing concerns about data privacy are leading to the development of privacy-focused blockchains and protocols. These solutions cater to users who prioritize anonymity and control over their data, potentially attracting new user segments.
Yield Farming and Earning Opportunities: Some DeFi protocols offer attractive returns through ""yield farming,"" where users stake their assets to earn rewards. While volatile and risky, it can incentivize new participants and increase liquidity in the DeFi ecosystem.
Of course past performance is not indicative of future results. Price increase is caused by multiple factors. Additionally, the market dynamics constantly evolve, making direct comparisons challenging.

Revenue models
Besides the well-known transactional type of revenue model [charging a fee for swapping and FOOR], here is a proposals for subscription based plans:
Exclusive access to DeFi services and Drops / Become go-to DeFi wallet for new comers
Offer preferential rates and early access to DeFi services and drops exclusively through lace [Play full IOG product ecosystem approach]
Freemium with in-app purchases and subscriptions
Blizzard drop
XSY token early access
Integration with DJED and preferential rates after X amount
Preferential access to a Dapp / Partnership with Dapps which are easy access within lace
Potential for integrating gamified elements like rewards, badges, and leaderboards into DeFi activities (staking, liquidity provision) and NFT interactions (collecting, trading).
The challenge here is balancing gamification with responsible financial practices and avoiding accusations of gambling or manipulation / Becoming a broker of securities
Advanced Security and Privacy Services
Offer advanced security features beyond basic encryption, such as:
Multi-party computation (MPC) for key management.
Zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced transaction privacy.
Secure enclaves for hardware-based key isolation.
Tax tool: Advance reporting VS basic reporting
Notification security service - Monitor tx activity and potential risks
Potential revenue stream by tiered subscriptions with increasing levels of security features.
Insurance against wallet hacks or theft.
Additional storage space for sensitive data.
Looking to engage with to the more security-conscious users and institutions.
The challenge here is balancing complex security features with user-friendliness, and convincing users of the value proposition and justifying premium pricing.
DeFi Aggregator and Portfolio Management Tool
[Could be implemented along with proposal #1]
Offer a comprehensive DeFi aggregator that simplifies access and management of various DeFi protocols within the Cardano ecosystem. We could add value by offering:
Create algorithms to automatically allocate user funds across different DeFi protocols for optimal returns [Wallstreet tech meets web3] - Automated yield optimization
Provide detailed insights into user holdings, returns, and risk exposure across various DeFi activities.
Allow users to personalize their DeFi exposure based on individual risk tolerance and goals - Customizable portfolio strategy
Potential revenue streams:
Subscription fees for access to premium features and automated strategies.
Performance-based fees for successful yield optimization outcomes.
Partnerships with DeFi protocols for referral fees or integration deals.
In which cases do I need to get a broker license?
What type of services can we take from banking digital experiences which could become premium features?
What should we launch to the market?
Considering the competitor's landscape, lace mobile wallet needs to offer a key differentiator
Hypothesis: Users do not get married with wallets. The cost of creating one is zero. In the custodial space, if you already have a favorite wallet, you will stay with that one. If a new wallet comes with a different feature, then you can create a new wallet there and give it a test. If you are concern with security, you will get yourself a hardware wallet.
So the question remains, what would make a user switch wallets? [Topic for user research]

Defi Aggregator and portfolio manager
A DeFi aggregator acts like a one-stop shop for various decentralized finance (DeFi) services. It essentially simplifies the complex DeFi ecosystem by bringing different functionalities together in one place. Here's a breakdown of what a DeFi aggregator does:
Combines services:
DeFi consists of numerous scattered protocols spread across different blockchains. DeFi aggregators bring together these services, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, yield farming, decentralized insurance, and liquidity pools.
Optimizes transactions:
By analyzing various DeFi platforms, aggregators aim to find the best possible deals for users. This could involve searching for the most favorable exchange rates for token swaps or identifying the lending services offering the highest yields.
Simplifies user experience:
Instead of manually searching through different DeFi protocols, users can leverage a DeFi aggregator's interface to access various services and execute transactions efficiently.
Automates tasks:
Certain DeFi aggregators, also known as yield aggregators, can automate specific tasks like yield farming. This involves automatically moving crypto assets between different DeFi protocols to maximize returns.
In simpler terms, DeFi aggregators function like search engines for DeFi services. They streamline the process for users by offering:
Centralized access:
Aggregators provide a single platform to access various DeFi functionalities.
Price comparison:
They search for the best deals across different DeFi protocols.
Automated transactions:
They can automate specific DeFi tasks for users.
While DeFi aggregators offer convenience, it’s important to highlight:
They are not without risks:
Like any DeFi interaction, there are inherent risks involved, such as smart contract vulnerabilities and potential scams.
Users should do their own research:
It's crucial to understand the underlying DeFi protocols before using an aggregator
[PAINT POINT FROM USERS]
Overall, DeFi aggregators play a significant role in making DeFi more accessible and user-friendly. They offer a simplified way to interact with various DeFi services, potentially saving time and effort for users.

ANNEX
Trends that can potentially increase web3 consumption
Cryptocurrency:
Over 400 million people globally own cryptocurrency, representing approximately 5% of the world's population.
Bitcoin remains the most widely held cryptocurrency, but other tokens like Ethereum and Solana are gaining traction.
Decentralized Finance (DeFi):
The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols peaked at over $400 billion in November 2021, but has since fluctuated around $100 billion
Lending and borrowing remain the most popular DeFi activities, although other functionalities like liquidity mining and decentralized exchanges are growing.
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):
NFT sales reached over $25 billion in the first half of 2022, showcasing their growing popularity
Art and collectibles are the most common NFT use cases, but applications in gaming, music, and other sectors are emerging.
Metaverse:
User numbers in major metaverse platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox are still relatively low, but growing steadily.
Gaming and virtual land ownership are the primary attractions currently, but the metaverse has the potential for diverse applications in the future.","How can the development of a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable mobile Web3 wallet contribute to the acceleration of decentralized finance technologies and foster a more inclusive and accessible decentralized ecosystem?","The development of a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable mobile Web3 wallet can contribute to the acceleration of decentralized finance technologies and foster a more inclusive and accessible decentralized ecosystem in several ways.

        Firstly, by offering a user-friendly interface, the wallet can help reduce the complexity and confusion that many users, especially those new to blockchain technology, face when managing and interacting with digital assets. This can lead to increased adoption and participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, as more people feel comfortable and confident in using these technologies.

        Secondly, a secure wallet is essential for protecting users' digital assets and maintaining trust in the decentralized ecosystem. By implementing robust security measures, the wallet can help prevent unauthorized access, theft, and loss of funds, thereby encouraging more users to engage with DeFi platforms.

        Thirdly, interoperability is crucial for enabling seamless interactions between different blockchain networks and decentralized applications. By supporting a wide range of blockchain networks, the wallet can help users access various DeFi services and opportunities, regardless of the underlying blockchain. This can lead to a more fragmented user experience and hinder broader adoption of DeFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other Web3 applications.

        Furthermore, the wallet's accessibility and convenience, made possible by mobile integration, can attract a larger user base, including those who may not have access to desktop computers. This can help foster a more inclusive decentralized ecosystem, where people from diverse backgrounds and geographical locations can participate in and benefit from decentralized finance technologies.

        In summary, the development of a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable mobile Web3 wallet can contribute to the acceleration of decentralized finance technologies and foster a more inclusive and accessible decentralized ecosystem by increasing adoption, enhancing security, promoting interoperability, and improving accessibility."

The designs uses the responsiveness figma plugin, being required to be adjusted respecting the rules of this plugin (like editing each breakpoint size component, for ex).

Daniel Smith",How should the DApp store frontend QA consider the MVP prototype's animations and look-and-feel baseline when addressing the re-linking of components from a separate UI toolkit to the original lace UI toolkit in the design file?,"The DApp store frontend QA should consider the MVP prototype's animations and look-and-feel baseline when addressing the re-linking of components from a separate UI toolkit to the original lace UI toolkit in the design file. This is because the MVP prototype serves as a reference for the desired visual and interactive elements of the DApp store, and the QA process should ensure that these elements are accurately represented in the design file. Additionally, the QA process should also take into account the responsiveness Figma plugin rules and the use of dittowords for legal copy review."

We are also suggesting ‘
Lace DApp Explorer

Due diligence
Dapp Radar has a component called ‘Explorer’ and it’s branded as
Dapp Radar Explorer
to mitigate the above we can use ‘Lace DApp Explorer’ (exact spelling).
Next action points
ask our Legal department to perform due diligence for the names
Lace DApp Explorer

The purpose of this system is to provide support, guidance, and a smooth transition for new hires during their first few weeks at the company. 

        The buddy, who is typically an employee from the same team or department, serves as a point of contact for the new employee, helping them navigate the company culture, understand the company's policies and procedures, and familiarize themselves with their role and responsibilities. 

        This system benefits new employees in several ways. Firstly, it helps them build relationships and connections within the company, which can be crucial for their integration and sense of belonging. Secondly, it provides them with a safe and confidential space to ask questions and express concerns, which can help alleviate anxiety and uncertainty. Thirdly, it enables them to learn from the experiences and insights of their buddy, which can accelerate their learning curve and improve their performance in their new role. 

        In summary, the Buddy System in the IO Global onboarding process is a valuable tool that supports new employees during their transition to the company, fosters a culture of collaboration and learning, and enhances their overall experience and success in their new role."
"In discussion with
Charles Morgan
the following was decided regarding Audit requirements for the DApp Store:
Only Internal Audit will be required.
For what Phases of the roll-out will an Audit be required:
Phase 1 - ClosedBeta (50 selected DApp Developers) on the PreProd network
No audit required
Phase 2 - Public Beta (any DApp Developer can submit) on the PreProd network
Internal audit is preferable
Phase 3 - Public Launch on Mainnet (any DApp Developer can submit
Internal audit is mandatory.
Link to Jira ticket from Cybersecurity to track the audit:
Discussion with
Charles Morgan
to clarify:
Charles Morgan
This really does not need a meeting as the criteria is simple:If the dApp store will handle cryptocurrency or fiat transactions, it needs an external audit. If it doesn't, we should be fine with an internal audit.
Marius Bock
It does not handle crypto or fiat transactions but registration is via an on-chain self-transaction with some metadata,  This transaction is initiated by the DAPP developer and monitored by the DAPP Store application.
The reason for the call was that we did not get any response and we needed some clarification.
Charles Morgan
I feel confident that an internal audit on that would be fine, based on the description you just gave me. I thought we had already hammered out what was needed, but it must not have been communicated properly, sorry about that.
Marius Bock
Thanks, there have been a lot of changes over the past year or 2 and some comms might have been lost.
How do we initiate this internal audit when we are ready?
Charles Morgan
a couple weeks before you you think you will be ready, you can submit a ticket for it through the support portal. This will allow us to get it worked into our schedule so we will have availability when you are ready to start.
Marius Bock
Also, we will do this in phases,
Phase 1 - ClosedBeta with 50 invited DAPP developers on Preprod
Phase 2 - Open Beta on Preprod
Phase 3 - Mainnet
I would think Phase 3 would require the internal audit, what about the other 2 phases?
Charles Morgan
Closed Beta - No
Open Beta - Preferably
MainNet - Must be completed before release
Marius Bock
Thanks Charles, no need for the call then, will cancel it.  If we have more questions, will pop them in chis channel.
Charles Morgan
That will work.  Also, if you ask me something in a channel and do not get a timely response, DM me --> I am in a ridiculous amount of channels and questions often get lost in the noise

And yes, Death by Slack is a common problem","For the internal audit of the DApp store, when should a ticket be submitted through the support portal to schedule the audit for each phase: Closed Beta, Open Beta, and Mainnet?","For the internal audit of the DApp store, a ticket should be submitted through the support portal a couple of weeks before the Closed Beta phase, which does not require an audit, is ready to start.

"This document contains monitoring, logging and alerting items that we would like to have.
Alerts:
oura not parsing blocks for sometime (sefa)
oura errors
oura down
grafana:
last block hash parsed by oura
last registered block hash in the app logs","""How can the last block hash parsed by oura and the last registered block hash in the app logs be monitored, and how can alerts be set up for oura not parsing blocks for some time, oura errors, and oura being down?""","To monitor the last block hash parsed by oura and the last registered block hash in the app logs, you can use a monitoring tool that can pull and display these metrics in real-time. For example, you can use Prometheus to scrape and store these metrics, and Grafana to visualize them.

To set up alerts for oura not parsing blocks for some time, oura errors, and oura being down, you can use an alerting tool that can trigger alerts based on certain conditions. For example, you can use Alertmanager, which is part of the Prometheus ecosystem, to define and manage alerts.

Here are the steps to set up monitoring and alerting:

1. Set up Prometheus to scrape the metrics from oura and the app logs. You can use the Prometheus node exporter to scrape system metrics from the machine where oura is running, and you can use a custom exporter to scrape the block hash metrics from oura and the app logs.
2. Set up Grafana to visualize the metrics. You can create a dashboard in Grafana that displays the last block hash parsed by oura and the last registered block hash in the app logs. You can also create alerts in Grafana that trigger when the metrics exceed certain thresholds.
3. Set up Alertmanager to manage the alerts. You can define alert rules in Alertmanager that trigger when oura is not parsing blocks for some time, when oura errors occur, or when oura is down. You can also configure Alertmanager to send notifications when the alerts trigger. For example, you can send notifications via email, Slack, or PagerDuty.

By following these steps, you can monitor the last block hash parsed by oura and the last registered block hash in the app logs, and you can set up alerts for oura not parsing blocks for some time, oura errors, and oura being down."

and don’t have ad blockers enabled.
Conclusion:
During December we’ve noticed a slight decrease in website visitors, however the users have navigated more pages than in the previous month;
The organic visitors also increased, an explanation could be the blog posts and social activity that brings traffic;
On 13th December, the day we released 1.8.0, we can notice a spike in traffic - 418 uniques; on the same day there are significantly more new visitors than returning
On 8th, 9th and 14th December we can see a small spike in SEO unique users. However, upon checking the content calendar I can’t identify the reason.
I can notice data that is marked as ‘Other’ with regards to countries, top website pages and best performing content
In terms of conversion (when someone clicks on ‘Add to browser’ button on lace.io), we have a slight increase since November, with a high CVR of 38.96%;
The conversion time increase with approximately 2 minutes
Most of these unique visitors came to
http://lace.io
directly, followed by searching on Google, then Twitter, and
http://cardanocube.io
As expected, most of our visitors are from the USA, followed by Canada, Australia and the UK.
It seems that we gained more of the North America and Asia traffic, but decreased in Europe
.
The
most successful campaign is the HubSpot newsletter
The most accessed page is the homepage, as expected, followed by features, then FAQs.
Even more (30.6%) users than in the previous month (25%) now access
lace.io
via their mobile phones.

Conclusion:
Out of
273 new wallets
created in December,
we notice a spike on 10th and 21st December
;
Out of
513 restored wallets
, w
e can see a spike on 6th December, which coincides with Lenfi integration
, 8th and 9th December,
From the visible data in the Google Chrome Store (not all is visible yet), t
he highest number of uninstallations (19) occurred on 8th December, followed by 9th December (16).
Looking at the above mention, it looks like
due to the Lenfi integration
and comms we got more people from the community to install Lace, but then immediately abandoning our wallet;
The churn rate during this month is 31.31%, very high, though there is a very mild decrease
.
We are seeing
more restored wallets
(513) than
new wallets
created during this time (273). The number of connected hardware wallets is 200;
The onboarding process for a
new wallet
shows that out of
526 people
who clicked ‘agree’ for the analytics tracking,
500 continued
the process to add the
wallet’s name
,
15 people dropped off,
leaving
485 people
to create a
password for the wallet
,
4 dropped off at the recovery phrase screen,
481 continued.
18 people dropped off
writing down the
first batch of their recovery phrase, leaving 463 to write down the second batch of the words.
3 more people dropped of before writing down their third batch of the recovery phrase.
36 people dropped off
in total when it came to fill in the recovery phrase
, leaving 423 to complete
the whole process. The 24-word recovery phrase seems to be the biggest problem in completing the whole process. The process took on average
15 minutes.
This means we need to improve the onboarding process;
On 8th and 9th December we’ve noticed the
highest amount of token transactions - 333, and 247;
On 8th and 9th December we’ve noticed a high number of DAU - 812 and 808
,
while the
highest activity happened on 13th and 14th December, around the 1.8.0 release 824 and 832
. The first 2 dates need more investigation.
The installs came from
USA (1,352)
, followed by Other (unspecified country due to opt-out from analytics) (975), UK (374), Australia (234), Germany (212), Canada (198), Vietnam (183);

To improve the onboarding process and reduce the number of people dropping off during the recovery phrase step, the process needs to be simplified, and the 24-word recovery phrase should be made less daunting. This could involve breaking it down into smaller parts or providing more guidance and support during this step. Additionally, the onboarding process should be tested with a larger group of users to identify any other areas where people are dropping off and address those as well."

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary (overall project)
We want to simultaneously deal with 3 high priority VoC requests AND have feature parity with Nami, a worthy goal in itself and a pre-requisite for Nami User Migration. Note that Multi-Wallet/Multi-Account is by far the majority of the work.
Tying this back to Lace Business themes, this is hugely important for retention and e2e-experience. Foundational features that while perhaps not business winning in their own right, are important building blocks that more innovative features can build upon.
Risks/Concerns (overall project)
Specifically for multi-wallet/account, concerned that whenever you have a nested account structure (and multiple mnemonics) that the cognitive load on the user gets much higher. We’ll need to make sure that we’re very carefully considering UX here.
Does our analytics infrastructure support the custom tracking that is outlined in the following scopes? Do we have analytics tools where that data can live and be visualized (ie on a dasboard)?
Out of Scope (overall project)
Trezor Support (covered separately)
Migration of Nami users (different project)
Nami feature development (in Nami)
Phases
Phase 1: Multi-Wallet / Multi-Account
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Adding multi-wallet and multi-account support is a table stakes feature, with some users not able to switch to Lace due to our current deficit, and others quickly churning after onboarding
Scope: Multiple wallets
Users can add (create/restore/pair) multiple Cardano wallets
Users can seamlessly switch between different wallets
Users can easily see the current wallet’s name
Users can remove a wallet without affecting the other ones
[Analytics] Are users removing their wallets?
Scope: Multiple accounts
Users can enable/disable additional accounts on existing wallets
Users can easily see the current account’s name (and where it’s nested)
Users can switch between accounts.
[Analytics] Are users enabling/disabling accounts (indexing)? Are users switching between accounts?
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
Need crisp designs around this; it’s an important feature that many users have been asking for
Technical implementation seems relatively straightforward.
Wallet Analytics are
mostly
already covered with our current setup, but we should make sure they are comprehensive (are users adding additional wallets? are users switching between wallet? how active are multi-wallet users?)
Phase 2: Asset Search
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
…
Scope for this phase
Search in Token or NFT views via AssetName,
AssetID
or PolicyID
[Analytics] Custom tracking to see what searches people are making and on which pages (and maybe more broadly, are the searches showing results?):
Volo’s suggestion:
we can capture if a user started typing anything in a search input on a particular tab
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
Simple frontend feature - no external dependencies
Phase 3: Custom Submission Endpoint
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Currently in Lace, users have no control over where a txn is submitted (it just happens at the closest data center). This new feature lets users specify their own URL for submitting txns. They may want to use their local node, etc. This gives users (power users) control over their network. For example, this allows users to leverage a very fast node/connection.
Scope for this phase
Lace Settings allows user to enter a URL into a textbox
Validate for valid URL format
Possibly
: Probe URL to see if a service is responding
[Analytics] Custom tracking that lets us see how often this feature is used and what the txn ID is (added to our normal analytics).
Volo’s suggestion:
“
how often this feature is used
” - do we truly need it now? Can we do it later?
Volo’s suggestion:
from privacy perspective, not sure if it is OK to track what the txn ID is
[Analytics] Augment existing tracking to see whether this feature is being turned on:
Volo’s suggestion:
it seems it should be easy to track
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Imple
mentation Notes (incl
Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
Simple feature, no changes in SDK
Lace currently submits Tx via Ogmios. Custom Submission API
May need an additional service added to our backend
Phase 4: [Delighter] Setting an NFT as your avatar
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Simply, Nami users can do this and it’s a nice little customization. Small effort to go a long way in look/feel.
Scope for this phase
In an NFT viewing screen (or menu), there should be an option to “Set as [Avatar]” or “Set as Profile Picture”
[Analytics] How often are users doing this?
Volo’s suggestion:
it seems it should be easy to track
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
-
Success Criteria/KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
Lace Extension has 100% feature parity with Nami
No additional user complaints/concerns about lacking these features (especially in relation to Nami)
Utilization (are users discovering/using this feature?
10% of Users set their profile picture
10% of Users create multiple wallets/accounts
Custom submission endpoint is used successfully in transactions
10% Growth in acquisition rate

Introduction & Main use cases
Introduction
Lace aspires to be the best Cardano wallet. While it has introduced some unique advances, it still lacks a few key features that many Cardano wallet applications already offer. Support for multiple wallets and multiple accounts are some of them, allowing users to manage wallets and accounts for different purposes within the same application.
Main use cases and their importance
Although there are multiple use cases for multiple wallets and multiple accounts, we’ll cover the main use case for each, and why it is important for Lace to support them:
Multiple wallets: HODL + Spending
Many users have two wallets, one for HODLing, which is usually a hardware wallet, with extra security, and another for day-to-day transactions. Ad-hoc wallets are also popular for quickly receiving funds and participating in NFT drops.
By supporting multiple accounts, we increase the chance these users will migrate to Lace.
Multiple accounts: multi-delegation
While Lace offers a more seamless multi-delegation solution, users can do so in other wallets by using multiple accounts, although it incurs more fees.
Until we support multiple accounts, users with this kind of multi-delegation can’t use Lace.

When dealing with a nested account structure and multiple mnemonics, the cognitive load on the user can become much higher. It is crucial to ensure that the UX is carefully considered to minimize this cognitive load. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the analytics infrastructure supports the custom tracking outlined in the scopes and that there are analytics tools where the data can live and be visualized, such as on a dashboard."

Summary
Banxa offers three checkout options
Global Checkout: This will be our generic Banxa checkout link that merchants will use to link out to Banxa checkout. The experience and journey will be the same each time. Due to simplicity, it is fastest to market.
Custom Checkout: Consumers will go through the merchant comparison and selection process before they are redirected to Banxa checkout. This journey is partially owned by the merchant. Our best and most complex offering.
Widget Checkout: Consumers will complete the checkout with Banxa via a Widget (iFrame) whilst remaining on the merchant website. This is a good balance between speed of integration and user experience.
As part of phase 1, we’ve selected the
Global Checkout
option for an MVP due to technical simplicity and ensuring the fastest time to market. The simple approach will provide essential insights to optimize the user journey as we gracefully aim to transition towards bespoke Custom Checkout (Option 2).
Long term
In the future, we aim to offer users an embedded experience to Banxa’s services as part of the Laces feature set enabling users to buy and sell ADA directly in the wallet. We plan to integrate Banxa’s API and connect it to our own embedded UI in Lace. For KYC and payment confirmation steps where the widget redirect is required, we’d require Banxa to customize their widget UI to provide a seamless experience for our users.
Short term
The first phase considers a more straightforward approach, i.e., a URL parametrization Referral Link. There will be no need to make API calls, nor does it require bespoke embedded design; instead, it provides low technical complexity while maintaining a high-impact outcome for end users. The experience and journey will be the same each time. Due to its simplicity, it is the fastest method to market.
Users will be directed to the Banxa order page which will be pre-filled with any parameters that were passed through. We can use this integration option if we do not require webhooks or price comparison within Lace.
Note
: Banxa confirmed that they have successfully assisted numerous partners through Google Play and Apple App Store registration process with respect to Banxa’s on/off ramp service, and will supply a compliance letter in support of Lace’s application when needed

Feature promise
A hassle-free experience, allowing users to buy ADA with fiat currencies and improving the accessibility for new and existing lace users to get started in Web3.
A streamlined experience allow users to buy AND sell ADA for fiat currencies
Customer pain points
Users lack a convenient way to quickly on-ramp and get started with Lace
Lace isers must have a way to sell ADA if they decide to otherwise we’ve created a new pain-point.
Product proof points
Users will experience a simple process to On Ramp and quickly get started in Web3, resulting  in an increase of user satisfaction and retention.
Fiat On/Off Ramp  simplifies conversion processes, eliminating unnecessary complexities and providing a straightforward experience for users to Buy and Sell ADA
Pricing
Banxa provides what you see is what you get quotations for end users. This price will cover everything from payment gateway fees, blockchain/network fees, Banxa fees, foreign exchange fees and tax.
As an example, if the payment method specifies a fee of 4.5%, you would receive $955 USDT from $1000 of USD ($45 in total fees).
The customer will not be charged more during the checkout journey with Banxa from the initial price that they see on the quotations page. Other on-ramps may show a lower fee for payment gateways and network fees, giving the impression that it is cheaper, but would later mark up the quotation later in the checkout journey. We do not work this way.
Additionally, we can create custom price arrangements and provide Banxa fee discounts for different volume ranges. As an example, if the payment method specifies a fee of 4.5%, you would receive $955 USDT from $1000 of USD ($45 in total fees).

Media/PR","What is the campaign strategy and hypothesis for the 'Shared wallet, safe wallet' campaign targeting new users and focusing on brand awareness, with a total budget of $X allocated to various activities such as content creation, social promotion, offline advertising, paid advertising, and webinars?","The campaign strategy for the 'Shared wallet, safe wallet' campaign is to increase brand awareness and acquire new users by leveraging various marketing activities. The hypothesis is that by investing in content creation, social promotion, offline advertising, paid advertising, and webinars, the campaign will drive significant interest and engagement, resulting in a 10% increase in signups.
        
        The total budget allocated to this campaign is $X, which will be distributed across the following activities:
        
        - Content creation: This includes the development of a blog post, two tweets, a Discord message, and an email. The budget for this activity is $Y, and the goal is to create engaging and informative content that resonates with the target audience and encourages them to learn more about the shared wallet and safe wallet offerings.
        
        - Offline advertising: This includes traditional advertising methods such as print ads, billboards, and radio spots. The budget for this activity is $Z, and the goal is to increase brand visibility and reach a wider audience.
        
        - Paid advertising: This includes online advertising methods such as pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns, display ads, and social media ads. The budget for this activity is $A, and the goal is to drive targeted traffic to the campaign landing page and increase signups.
        
        - Webinars: This includes hosting educational webinars to educate potential users about the benefits of shared wallets and safe wallets. The budget for this activity is $B, and the goal is to provide valuable insights and build trust with the target audience.
        
        The campaign roadmap includes specific deadlines and milestones for each activity, and the team will use tools such as Trello and Jira to stay on track and ensure timely delivery of all campaign deliverables. The success of the campaign will be measured by tracking metrics such as signups, engagement, and reach, and the team will adjust the strategy as needed to maximize results."

Strategy
We believe that XSY, an innovative liquidity accelerator infrastructure (or Liquidity OS), is born at the right time, and in the right economic context. With a
soft launch
in early in 2024, we plan to address the industry’s pain points, and capture valuable information to better enhance our services.
XSY will deploy
brand awareness marketing initiatives in its first 6 months
to test product-market fit for a PoC service, which can be used as an use case.
Ultimately, we need to achieve our long-term goals:
Accelerate economic activity (EA)
Accelerate money velocity (MV)

"Jack Rousian
Michael Chappell",What is the significance of including both Jack Rousian and Michael Chappell in the context?,"The significance of including both Jack Rousian and Michael Chappell in the context is that they are both prominent figures in the world of NASCAR racing. Jack Rousian is a well-known team owner and former driver, while Michael Chappell is a former crew chief. Together, they bring a wealth of experience and expertise to the sport, and their inclusion in the context suggests that they are important figures to consider when discussing NASCAR racing. Additionally, the fact that they are both mentioned together may indicate that they have worked together in some capacity, further emphasizing their significance in the world of NASCAR."

Grand Total 2023 8657","""Comparing the Grand Total of 2022 and 2023 from Cardano Gaming high-level stats and the Influencers for Lace report, can you identify a potential trend or insight in the growth and influence of the lace industry in the Cardano ecosystem?""","The Grand Total of 2022 for Cardano Gaming high-level stats is 11127, while the Grand Total of 2023 is 8657. This represents a decrease of 2,470 in the total number of users in the Cardano gaming ecosystem between 2022 and 2023.

        In contrast, the Influencers for Lace report does not provide specific numbers or statistics related to the lace industry in the Cardano ecosystem. However, it does provide a list of influencers and their respective social media reach and engagement metrics.

        Based on this information, it is difficult to identify a clear trend or insight in the growth and influence of the lace industry in the Cardano ecosystem. The decrease in the Grand Total for Cardano Gaming high-level stats from 2022 to 2023 may suggest a broader trend of decreased user engagement in the Cardano ecosystem. However, without specific data on the lace industry within the Cardano ecosystem, it is impossible to make a definitive conclusion.

        It is possible that the influencers listed in the Influencers for Lace report may have a significant impact on the growth and influence of the lace industry within the Cardano ecosystem. However, further research and data collection would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis."
"Introduction
Why the world
improvement
in the subject?
A
local testnet
is just a development tool, so it has mainly two requirements:
it must satisfy test cases requirements;
it should make the developers life quality as high as possible.
Our
local tesnet
(part of
cardano-js-sdk
) more than meets the first requirement while has a couple of problems about the second one:
it is not always so easy to update it to satisfy new test cases;
it is built using more standards: mixed yaml and json configuration files, mixed bash and JavaScript scripts...
its main issue is
it takes a dozen of minutes, at each run, to be ready
;
the main purpose of this proposal is to improve our
local tesnet
on these sides.
Core change proposal
The reason for the ~12' delay at startup is to let some epochs to go; some test cases requires this scenario.
The idea which originated this proposal is to
move
the activity performed inside the
testnet
from the
initial stage
of
docker run
phase to the
docker build
phase.
Implementation details
The structure of the network itself (more working
cardano-node
daemons with ad hoc network configuration and genesis) is pretty good, no changes on this side are planned.
Create a new TypeScript script which governs the
testnet
in all stages of its lifetime:
initialization: download and patch the network configuration and genesis files;
start up
and
shut down
the
cardano-node
s with the required customizations both for the
docker build
and the
docker run
phases;
perform the actions (i.e. submit the transactions) during the
docker build
phase to create all the required test cases;
Expose everything required to interact with the
testnet
(the socket, the mnemonics, the submitted tx ids to let the tests to know which are the txs concurring in creating the required test cases, the stake pool ids with their expected status, etc…) through a
docker volume
.
Side changes proposals
Publish on ghcr.io
Currently the
local testnet
is build through
docker compose
at each startup (
docker cache
helps saving time here) and it doesn’t exists as its own.
One more interesting improvement could be to publish it on ghcr.io .
Pros
One single build can serve all the developers.
SDK CI tests can download the pre-built image to save time on this side as well.
It can be used by other teams, also from outside IOG.
Cons
Requires more development time.
New dedicated github repository
Obviously, if the decision is not to publish it on ghcr.io, this makes no sense as the files need to live in the SDK repository.
On the other hand, an open source published docker image may deserves a dedicated repository to isolate documentation and support requests and to facilitate the contribution from the open source community.","How can the local testnet's start-up time and configuration management be improved, and what are the potential benefits and drawbacks of publishing the testnet on ghcr.io?","The local testnet's start-up time can be improved by moving the activity performed inside the testnet from the initial stage of the docker run phase to the docker build phase. This would involve creating a new TypeScript script that governs the testnet in all stages of its lifetime, including initialization, start-up and shut down of the cardano-node daemons, and performing actions during the docker build phase to create all required test cases. Additionally, the script would expose everything required to interact with the testnet through a docker volume.
        The local testnet's configuration management can be improved by addressing the issues of difficulty in updating the testnet to satisfy new test cases and the use of mixed yaml and json configuration files and mixed bash and JavaScript scripts.
        Publishing the local testnet on ghcr.io has potential benefits such as serving all developers with a single build, saving time on SDK CI tests, and making it available for use by other teams. However, there are also potential drawbacks such as requiring more development time and the need for a new dedicated github repository if the decision is made to publish it on ghcr.io. Additionally, if the files need to live in the SDK repository, publishing on ghcr.io would not make sense. An open source published docker image may also deserve a dedicated repository to isolate documentation and support requests and to facilitate contribution from the open source community."
"Danilo Prates
Rhys Bartels Waller",What is the significance of mentioning both Danilo Prates and Rhys Bartels Waller in this context?,"The significance of mentioning both Danilo Prates and Rhys Bartels Waller in this context is not explicitly clear without additional information. However, based on the context provided, it can be inferred that they are both individuals who are relevant in some capacity. It is possible that they are colleagues, associates, or individuals who share a common interest or field of work. Without further context, it is not possible to determine the exact significance of mentioning them together."

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary (overall project)
DJED offers a blend of stability and decentralization. Designed to mitigate cryptocurrency volatility, DJED maintains a stable value, facilitating reliable transactions, and serving as a dependable medium for savings and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Leveraging Cardano's secure and scalable platform, promises lower transaction costs and enhanced efficiency. By integrating DJED into the lace wallet we believe [
hypothesis
], we will increase it’s usage by streamlining the experience from the get go at the moment any users creates/recovers a wallet in lace.
Risks/Concerns (overall project)
The integration of DJED and SHEN into the Lace wallet involves complex interactions between various components, including the user interface, the Cardano blockchain, and the smart contract itself. This complexity can lead to technical challenges such as interoperativility, scalability and synchronization issues.
Out of Scope (overall project)
NA
Phases
(note: there might be only one phase!)
Phase 1: Dev work + Design process
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
Lace wallet represents means to an end, the gateway to entering the Cardano space. DJED is the key to access all the DEFI universe of possibilities within our ecosystem. By merging these two projects, we believe we can increase visibility, onboard new users and full seamless DEFI experience in Cardano. In order to achieve this, we require work in two different fronts:
Front and back-end effort
Design effort
There are several questions that arise regarding what’s the best experience we can provide by integrating Djed into lace. Therefore, we need to go through a discovery process so we can properly define such UX and UI. Both effort can run in parallel.
Scope for this phase
Add support on the cardano-js-sdk for plutus scripts
Implement function to compute transaction body scriptDataHash
Expose endpoint in the SDK to compute execution units
Update input selection to support adding arbitrary inputs as part of the selection result
Update the transaction builder to support Plutus scripts
DJED Specific work on the SDK
Track liquidity
Track the state of the DJED smart contract
Contract Interaction
Work on the wallet
Discovery research process
Design and create Lace UI/UX in Lace based on research conclusion
Out of Scope for this phase
NA
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
The work to do in the front-end is straight forward, we might require more support for the back-end
Should we build a solution sharable with the ecosystem so others wallets also support DJED?

Summary
On the
31 Jan 2024
Nami v3.7.0
was released, marking the first release since the IOG acquisition. All manual testing was successful, before and after the release, however some hours into the Chrome extension rollout phase, access to the backend API (Blockfrost) was failing due to the wrong API account key used in the build, and subsequent rate limiting in effect. After being notified in the Lace support channel of users discussing the outage in X (Twitter), the issue was diagnosed and ultimately service restored by re-provisioning the account receiving the API requests from Nami v3.7.0.
The intent of this release was to make a minimal update to:
Comply with IOG legal standards
Replace visual references from Berry Pool
Rework the delegation feature to not have Berry Pool as the only option
Remove legacy
testnet
option
Instrument the application for collecting anonymous analytics to better assess the user activity to develop a migration to Lace plan.
A decision was made to
not
fix legacy bugs, and
not
improve build or release processes, since there’s uncertainty on how we will proceed with retaining or incorporating the UX of Nami into Lace, which will be mostly be driven by data collected
after
this release has been made. It was however brought to our attention that the analytics implementation was potentially in violation of
article 7(3) of the GDPR
, as there was no feature to opt-out of the original decision made buy the user to opt-in.
Impact
Affected users were unable to sync chain state changes or submit transactions between the hours of
2130-0000
on
31 Jan 2024
and
0455-0824
on
01 Feb 2024
. Funds were secure and users could access the network via alternative wallet software, including Lace, which is a good backup strategy in general.

Total Requests to the security@iohk.io Blockfrost account (UTC+1)
Root Cause Analysis
Why did the API requests fail?
A valid but under-provisioned account key was used rather than the expected Nami account key, which is a
starter plan
key limited to 50k/reqs per day.
Why was this not discovered during pre-release testing?
The key provides identical access if the limit is not exceeded, and testing does not deplete the request balance.
Chrome extensions are rolled out to users over a number of hours, and the sanity checks were performed soon after the rollout began, before the account limit was reached.
How did the wrong API key get used?
All secret material is stored in VaultWarden, which is a shared service with users in various chapters and tribes. Prior to the Nami acquisition, an existing record was stored in the vault as below:
Contributing Factors
:
This record contained no username, which
could
have been set as the account identifier
security@iohk.io
to better identify it.
It was global and not restricted to only users who require access, presumably members of the security team.
Nami credentials were expected to be available in VaultWarden, and this vague record was assumed to be for Nami. Once it was set and demonstrated to be working, there was no reason to question its validity. The mistake was made during migration of credentials, where clearly the Nami account Blockfrost keys were not added to VaultWarden.
Why did we not notice the issue independently?
Nami uses Blockfrost as its backend, which has some level of monitoring from a service provider’s perspective, but its geared towards ensuring account capacity is sufficient rather than alerting based on usage patterns.
Why did it take ~6hrs for a response?
Posts made to the
#lace-support
channel are not covered by our on-call team and the timing meant it would be attended when eastern Europeans started their day.
Why was the notification made to the
#lace-support
channel rather than triggering an on-call response?
There is not an established process for communicating a potential service disruption since we have monitoring in place for Lace via the backend services we control.
Corrective Action Plan
Promote the
security@iohk.io
account to the same provisioning as
nami@iohk.io
Rename the vague VaultWarden item to avoid confusion in future
Request all items added to VaultWarden contain enough detail to properly identify account keys, and limit items to be added to the global space.
Add the missing item for Nami Blockfrost keys
Define a formal incident response plan, including notifying legal, and triggering an on-call response.
Create a crisis response plan, with input from legal.
Chrome extensions can be
configured for partial rollout
, as a percentage. We should investigate strategies to minimise impact in future, using the initial cohort to verify the update is not causing a disruption.
Automate the build in a GitHub workflow to reduce the chance of API key mismatch in future, and reduce the risk associated with building locally, plus make it auditable.
Update Nami to use the intended account API key
Demote the
security@iohk.io
account back to a starter plan once the update has rolled out completely.
Consider a notification hook feature in Blockfrost to set thresholds of expected usage per API endpoint. This could feed into our existing monitoring system to alert operations teams of the issue in real time.
Consider improvements in social network monitoring to improve reaction time.","What was the primary factor that contributed to the use of an under-provisioned API key in the Nami v3.7.0 release, leading to the service outage?","The primary factor that contributed to the use of an under-provisioned API key in the Nami v3.7.0 release, leading to the service outage, was the vague record in VaultWarden.

"This document will be used by the Lace Tribe as a guide for incidents.
It will be based on
this
and
this
links.
Steps
Pre-release
Reactive messages
Define who is going to be in charge
Define who’s on the rotation
Post-release
Determine if a situation warrants being escalated to an incident
Identify the incident
Analyze the severity level","For the Lace Tribe's incident guide, what are the specific responsibilities of the person in charge and the team on rotation during the post-release phase, particularly in determining if a situation should be escalated, identifying the incident, and analyzing its severity level?","The person in charge during the post-release phase for the Lace Tribe's incident guide is responsible for determining if a situation warrants being escalated to an incident. This involves evaluating the situation and making a judgment call on whether it meets the criteria for an incident. If it does, the person in charge would then initiate the incident response process.

        The team on rotation during the post-release phase is responsible for identifying the incident once it has been determined that a situation warrants escalation. This involves gathering information about the incident, such as its impact, scope, and root cause. The team on rotation would also be responsible for analyzing the severity level of the incident, which involves assessing the potential impact of the incident on the Lace Tribe's operations, customers, and reputation.

        Based on the analysis of the severity level, the team on rotation would then determine the appropriate response to the incident, such as deploying additional resources, implementing mitigation measures, or communicating with stakeholders. The person in charge and the team on rotation would work closely together to manage the incident and ensure that it is resolved effectively and efficiently."

Candidates for 1.10 release
In this version of Lace we’ve included the below candidates:
1/ 3
Transaction Representation improvement
(click for more details)
Our current Tx representation looks wrong or incomplete in several scenarios. This area is quite important given that most Lace’s traffic come from DApps, and majority of scams are carried out through the DApp bridge. As of now, users that interact with dapps can’t see the whole view of what the Tx is carrying, not knowing what exactly they’re signing. This situation opens up many scenarios where the user is subject to fraud, which as a financial product raises deep concerns. Recent events in Cardano ecosystem have highlighted the weakness of wallets protecting users, including Lace.  Here are some example of recent events:
-
Wallet drained 1
(mint case)
-
Wallet drained 2
465k ADA stolen (NFT gift ADA drop scam)
-
Wallet drained 3
101k ADA stolen + NFTs (mint case)
- Discussion thread 1
""This is a wallet UX issue""
-
Discussion thread 2
""
We’re not ready for mass adoption.""
-
Discussion thread 3
-
Discussion thread 4
""Cardano wallets implement better TX previews and potentially even warning messages for when suspicious Txs arrive""
While all Cardano wallets are exposed to this problem, Lace is currently behind top wallets.
This feature addresses part of the concerns voiced by the community in the fundamental base (possible and recommended to add more features on top). It’s composed of many small improvements that overall create a large impact of the dapp interaction experience. The scope has been split in three phases to deliver incremental value.
In Lace 1.10 we are releasing Phase 1 out of 3, which looks at:
Add a summary in the DApp bridge (wallet connect/ DApp connector) of all assets involved in the Tx from the wallet POV, summarizing to users what are the changes about to be executed on their wallet
Add NFTs thumbnails to the DApp bridge summary
Add collateral information to the DApp bridge, supporting former and output collateral types
Remove address redundancies in input/output sections: show only addresses in one section
By the end of this phase, in the DApp bridge of Lace, users will be able to easily read all asset information carried in the Tx requested to be signed, having a clean summary of assets being exchanged from the wallet POV, including thumbnails for NFTs and support for the new collateral output.

        To drive traffic to the website, the content strategy roadmap can be implemented by creating blog posts for each persona to address persona pain points, interests, and educate, creating Discord stages and Twitter spaces, producing product features videos, SEO tweaks, researching and creating templates for ‘How to use a wallet’ and sharing with community leaders, collaborating with 5-10 nano influencers in the Cardano ecosystem for content, and researching and producing infographics that can be shared within the community.
        To create brand awareness, the content strategy roadmap can be implemented by taking part in external Twitter spaces, using social media, researching events to take part in, researching podcasts to take part in, participating in external podcasts, sponsoring community events, and sharing the whitepaper and using PR.
        To establish Lace as the distribution channel for the XSY Liquidity OS, the content strategy roadmap can be implemented by including Lace on the XSY website, redoing Lace messaging within the XSY context, communicating the Lace + DJED integration, and creating a handle (ADA Handle) for users.
        Additionally, the content strategy roadmap should include a social media strategy + calendar for 3 months, a community strategy + plan for 3 months, and a content plan for each quarter, sprint cycle, or other period of time. The action items should be prioritized and include detailed action items and plans for each period of time.

Summary
During deployment of an update to our Muesli Swap API proxy, to whitelist a new optimised endpoint as requested by the Muesli Swap team, we detected access to the old endpoint had been blocked for our proxy which resulted in Lace users being served old data from the cache.
Timeline
2024-01-11 16:27 UTC
— Muesli Swap team reached on Discord to request we upgrade to a new custom endpoint they’ve deployed, to reduce the demand the Lace proxy is placing on the API. The plan was to limit “access to the [current] endpoint.. … by the end of this month or latest mid February”
2024-01-12 16:21 UTC
— Rhys acknowledged
2024-01-14 13:50 UTC
— Last successful cache update on
https://muesliswap.live-mainnet.eks.lw.iog.io/list?base-policy-id=&base-tokenname=
2024-01-16 10:55 UTC
— A PR with updates to our proxy
2024-01-16 13:38 UTC
— Test deployment to
https://muesliswap.ops-preview-1.eks.lw.iog.io/
(new endpoint works, old one returns 503).
2024-01-17 11:49 UTC
— Gytis says he’s on PTO and to engage Berno instead
2024-01-17 19:37 UTC
— Berno starts the investigation
2024-01-18 12:15 UTC
— Michal pairs with Berno to investigate some more,
2024-01-18 13:20 UTC
— We finally detect that requests from Amazon to
https://api.muesliswap.com/list?base-policy-id=&base-tokenname=
are banned and return 503, and report that to Rhys
2024-01-18 13:59 UTC
— Rhys asks Muesli Swap team to confirm the restriction.
Impact
Token pricing is informational only, however, Lace users were being served stale pricing data up to 5 days old.
Root Causes Analysis
Why did the MS API reject our proxy’s requests?
There’s a limit of 5 requests per hour in place and we exceeded this limit by sending an upstream request
for each
of our user requests.
Why did it only just happen now, despite there being no changes on our side?
Initial hypothesis:
The MS team performed a server update around this time so it’s
likely we ended up exceeding the request limit during the outage, retrying every 1 minute, and have since been fetching at a rate that keeps us on the ban list.
To trigger this behavior, an
anomalous response time of more than 10 s
was needed, which caused a proxy cache lock timeout, and another request before the first one finished. This interfered with their rate limiter which made the 2nd request wait for 60 s, which timed out the second cache lock. This caused many subsequent upstream requests, each failing with a 503. None of those requests were cached, because of the cache lock timeout. A detailed explanation is added to the end of the document.
Why didn’t we detect these rejections?
There was no monitoring in place, of:
either
X-Cache-Status:
— instead of the usual
HIT
it was constantly
UPDATING
,
or of the cache file modification timestamp,
or error logs of the proxy.
Corrective Action Plan
Short term: Adjust our proxy to stop over requesting the data.
Add monitoring to our proxy to be alerted of future request errors. The
GET /health
endpoint will also include
last_cache_hit
timestamp. We will alert once it’s too old.
Detailed technical explanation
MuesliSwap configured a rate limiter of 1 request/minute/IP without
nodelay
and a
burst
of 1, which means:
that you can ~instantly get a response when you request less often than 1 r/m,
for the 2nd request they
will keep you waiting
(i.e. open connection, no read) until that 1 minute since the 1st request passed, and respond then,
for the 3rd request within that minute, they
will respond with a 503
Service Unavailable
Michal Rus
has configured
proxy_cache_lock
which is a lock for an upstream resource. If we’re already waiting for a response, then subsequent requests from our clients will not cause other requests to upstream — instead they will wait for that first response. Which is what we want.
But he also set
proxy_cache_lock_timeout
to only 10 s. This means that this lock has a timeout. If 10 s pass without a response from upstream, it will be automatically unlocked, and another request to upstream will be send (from that 2nd+ request(s) of our clients).
When those upstream requests finally return something (either 200 OK, or 503 (from their rate limiter), or 504 (gateway timeout on our side)),
nothing will be cached
.
So we got into a loop which went like this:
Cache is invalidated (it’s too stale, that’s normal).
We request from upstream, but they unfortunately take more than 10 seconds to respond this time — some anomaly that can happen.
Because of that our
proxy_cache_lock
times out and we issue another request which their rate limiter keeps hanging for 1 minute.
This causes another
proxy_cache_lock
timeout for that 2nd request, so we issue a 3rd.
This 3rd one returns immediately with a 503.
We get a 4th request from our user, which is passed immediately to upstream because all locks are timed out, and 3rd one returned immediately. We get another 503.
Once the 2nd request is unblocked by upstream after 60 s, even if it is a 200 OK, we don’t cache it, because its cache lock timed out too.
Since none of those responses are cached because of the lock timeout, we still serve the
last cached
response to our users which was 200 OK 4 days ago.
At this point we've sent so many requests (that each returned a 503), that the next one we send will be hanging for another 60 s.
Go back to point
c.
The solution is to:
Increase
proxy_cache_lock
timeout to infinity, i.e. never send another request before this one returned.
At the same time control
connect()
and
send()
timeouts (not that important, I kept them at defaults).
But also set the
read()
timeout slightly higher than their rate limiter. This should never matter in normal operation, because we’ll be getting their responses immediately, but just in case (e.g. there are two proxies on the same Amazon IP, so in theory it could matter).",What configuration change to the proxy's cache lock timeout and read timeout could have prevented the loop of repeated requests and 503 errors when accessing the Muesli Swap API?,"To prevent the loop of repeated requests and 503 errors when accessing the Muesli Swap API, the proxy's cache lock timeout should be increased to infinity, i.e. never send another request before this one returned. Additionally, the read() timeout should be set slightly higher than the Muesli Swap API's rate limiter. This should never matter in normal operation, because the proxy will be getting responses immediately, but it provides a safety measure in case of anomalies."

Phases
(note: there might be only one phase!)
We propose the following phases assuming a small team of 2 engineers. With a bigger team we could progress phase 1 and 2 in parallel. It goes as follows:
Phase 1:
Engine / Low fidelity design
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
In this initial phase, our primary focus is on laying the foundational business logic and abstraction layers essential for the wallet. By starting with a simplified set of features and iterating based on feedback, we aim to deploy an internal build featuring a basic UI for comprehensive testing. On the other hand, we also need to design the latest features which were added to the browser version e.g. Multi-staking. Plus, define market launch and potential partnerships which could increase lace’s userbase.. It is important to note neither multi-chain nor the improvement of the feature releasement impacts our effort. We can progress this phase without depdendnices with those two projects.
In summary, phase 1 will entail engineering effort, design effort and business effort all different tracks moving in parallel.
Scope for this phase
Users can add (create/restore) multiple wallets
Users can manage portfolio
Users can check balance
Users can view transaction history
Users can build transaction
Users can send txs
Users can receive txs
Users can delegate to a stake pool
Users can secure wallet
Users can use basic settings
Users can connect to dapps
Define UX and UI for missing [FOOR, Multi-staking, Multi-sig, etc]
Go to market strategy
Out of Scope for this phase
UI toolkit
High fidelity screen designs and implementation
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
The onboarding flow is almost complete. We need to update based on the latest changes the extension wallet implemented.
Secure wallet: Change passcode; biometrics
Phase 1 is crucial for answering key questions and establishing a solid foundation for future development
Phase 2: High fidelity design
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
For this phase we will focus on improving the UI and overall wallet experience by implementing high fidelity designs. We will also require going through a
user testing exercise
to make sure all the experience plays out nicely. This will require usability testing as we polish the UX/UI, and a invite only beta test within the community, before we launch, to test the overall experience.
Scope for this phase
UI toolkit / design system -
Revamp phase 1 screens
Analytics

Phase 3: Feature
parity
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
Considering a basic functionality wallet will not make major difference in the market, for this phase we will aim at feature parity depending on the progress we have made on the improvement of the release process for both extension and mobile.
Scope for this phase

Why
Parellelise the effort to deliver awesome mobile experience, whilst delivering fast and cheaply an offering that allows us to prove the same hypothesis","What are the key objectives and scope of each phase in the development of the Lace mobile application, considering a small team of two engineers?","Phase 1:
The key objective of Phase 1 is to lay the foundational business logic and abstraction layers essential for the wallet. The scope includes engineering effort to deploy an internal build featuring a basic UI for comprehensive testing, design effort to define the latest features added to the browser version, and business effort to define the go-to-market strategy and potential partnerships. The scope also includes users being able to add multiple wallets, manage their portfolio, check balance, view transaction history, build and send transactions, receive transactions, delegate to a stake pool, secure their wallet, use basic settings, and connect to dapps. The onboarding flow and secure wallet features are crucial in this phase.
        
        Phase 2:
The key objective of Phase 2 is to improve the UI and overall wallet experience by implementing high fidelity designs and conducting user testing exercises. The scope includes revamping phase 1 screens, implementing a UI toolkit/design system, and conducting usability testing and an invite-only beta test within the community.
        
        Phase 3:
The key objective of Phase 3 is to achieve feature parity with the lace extension. The scope includes implementing notifications, address book, multi-delegation, FOOR, governance, Metadex, and hardware wallet support. This phase requires a bigger team for front-end effort and depends on the progress made on improving the releasing process."

DESIRED OUTCOMES
This is a success if and only if:
User can see the current Cardano network’s state regarding mempool capacity
Wallets only have to transmit each transaction once even if the rejection is due to mempool exceeding capacity
Problem Statement
Problem #1
: the Lace user is sending a Tx and not getting it confirmed in long time, or just longer than expected without knowing what's going on/what's the issue, talking specifically about the blockchain congestion scenario.
Problem #2
: The other issue this features covers is queuing Tx in our backend, instead of having the client to retry submissions or error back to the user
High-level scope
Phase 1:
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
once Lace mempool is full, a newly submitted transaction can not get into it, hence, the user sees the hanging spinner constantly without any indication or guaranty that the user transaction will be submitted. Increasing the Lace node mempool size ensures that there is enough space to fit a new transaction into the mempool immediately, hence, the user will see the “Submitted” transaction status in Lace, assuring that their transaction is submitted.
Scope for this phase
SRE
:
Increase node mempool size:
https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/3343/files#diff-0f34d8b804076e6d3b92b60639212c401501d48efd87e3f2b1a394e12b7f8831R269-R273
Set up mempool monitoring/alerts
BE
:
Add mempool monitoring Prometheus metric (days of work)
implementation with ogmios
https://ogmios.dev/mini-protocols/local-tx-monitor/
Delete RabbitMq (just clean-up work) (days of work)
QA:
we can set up the following test:
test #1: create a script to submit a lot of transactions to get the lace node mempool full to see what happens and if the mempool alerts are triggered
Out of Scope for this phase
developing this feature
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
this work is highly dependent on SRE
Phase 2: Lace user can see anticipated time to adopt a transaction on Cardano blockchain
Lace user is ensured that their submitted transaction doesn’t get rejected due to network load/congestion
Client sends Tx only once, no matter what is congestion/overload on the backend or blockchain side
Increase mempool size
of our mainnet node
https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/3343/files#diff-0f34d8b804076e6d3b92b60639212c401501d48efd87e3f2b1a394e12b7f8831R269-R273
Lace user can see anticipated time to adopt a transaction on Cardano blockchain as if it is sent now
The API will need to serve the current state of the Cardano network mempool for display in Lace
Average time to adoption for transactions in real time
A visual component in Lace that displays the expected time to adoption in the send screen
Proposal to use user-friendly colors with time ranges (less than 20 sec, less than 2 min, etc)
Lace user is ensured that their submitted transaction doesn’t get rejected due to network load/congestion
Client sends Tx only once, no matter what is congestion/overload on the backend or blockchain side
Increase mempool size
of our mainnet node
https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/3343/files#diff-0f34d8b804076e6d3b92b60639212c401501d48efd87e3f2b1a394e12b7f8831R269-R273
Lace DevOps can see Lace node mempool metric and alerts
Set up mempool monitoring (new metric and alert)
Lace system (backend and infra) can withstand XX transaction load per second
Are all backend components scaled enough to stand a bull run?
ICE
Impact: 5/6
This feature affects the user satisfaction in scenarios of high load of Cardano. It’s one more datapoint in the overall UX of the user. B
By itself it won’t likely change overall UX of the user, but it accounts as one more datapoint to take into account.
It can provide a differentiation compared to other wallets, a subtle difference that users appreciate
Confidence: 8/9 (proposed)
According to last bull run we’re confident this scenario impacts users UX.

to fill in","How does increasing the Lace node mempool size contribute to ensuring that a user's transaction is submitted and providing them with a ""Submitted"" status in Lace, while also addressing the issue of queuing transactions in the backend?","Increasing the Lace node mempool size contributes to ensuring that a user's transaction is submitted and providing them with a ""Submitted"" status in Lace by allowing a newly submitted transaction to be immediately fitted into the mempool, even when it is full. This assures the user that their transaction has been submitted and prevents them from continuously seeing a hanging spinner without any indication of the transaction's status. Additionally, increasing the mempool size addresses the issue of queuing transactions in the backend by ensuring that there is enough space to fit new transactions, eliminating the need for the client to retry submissions or error back to the user. This is achieved by implementing a mempool monitoring Prometheus metric with ogmios and deleting Rabbitmq, which are both backend changes. The QA team will also set up a test to create a script that submits a lot of transactions to get the Lace node mempool full and trigger the mempool alerts."

1. Trustless transaction construction using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet,"""Explain how trustless transaction construction is achieved using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet.""","Trustless transaction construction using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet is achieved through the following steps:

        1. Key Generation: The Lace Light Wallet generates a new key pair for each transaction, ensuring that the user's private key is never exposed.

        2. Transaction Creation: The user creates a transaction by specifying the recipient's address and the amount to be transferred. The transaction is then signed using the user's private key.

        3. Mithril Integration: Mithril is a lightweight, secure, and decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data to smart contracts. In the context of Lace Light Wallet, Mithril is used to verify the transaction details, such as the recipient's address and the transaction amount, before the transaction is broadcast to the network.

        4. Transaction Verification: Mithril verifies the transaction details by querying multiple data sources and cross-referencing the information. Once the transaction details have been verified, Mithril generates a proof-of-data (PoD) that is attached to the transaction.

        5. Transaction Broadcast: The transaction, along with the PoD, is then broadcast to the network. The network nodes use the PoD to verify the transaction details, ensuring that the transaction is valid and trustworthy.

        6. Transaction Confirmation: Once the transaction has been verified by the network nodes, it is added to the blockchain and considered confirmed.

        By using Mithril for trustless transaction construction, Lace Light Wallet ensures that all transactions are secure, verifiable, and tamper-proof, providing users with a high level of trust and confidence in the transaction process."

"In the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem, users face significant challenges in managing and interacting with digital assets in a secure, intuitive, and efficient manner.
Despite the proliferation of Web3 wallets, many users, especially those new to blockchain technology, struggle with complexities around wallet setup, security measures, and the nuanced understanding required to safely navigate decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and cross-chain transactions.
Additionally, the existing solutions often fail to offer a seamless integration with a wide range of blockchain networks,
leading to a fragmented user experience and hindering broader adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other Web3 applications.
Our objective is to develop a mobile Web3 wallet that addresses these challenges by offering a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable platform. This wallet will empower both novice and experienced users to manage their digital assets effortlessly, engage with dApps across different blockchains, and participate in the digital economy with confidence. By doing so, we aim to accelerate the adoption of Web3 technologies and foster a more inclusive and accessible decentralized ecosystem.
Why mobile
Where do wallets go? In your pocket!
Accessibility and Convenience:
Most people carry their smartphones everywhere, making mobile wallets readily accessible for everyday use.
Integration with Mobile Apps:
Easy integration with existing mobile apps and potential expansion into mobile-based decentralized applications (dApps).
Frictionless User Experience:
Leverage existing smartphone features like biometric authentication and camera scanning for convenient transactions.
Wider Audience Reach:
May attract a larger user base due to mobile's broader accessibility compared to desktop computers.trends
Overall Users:
Active Wallets:
As of October 2023, there are around 80 million unique active wallets interacting with DeFi protocols, indicating potential user numbers for broader Web3 applications
Demographics:
Early adopters tend to be young (25-34 years old), tech-savvy, and interested in finance and investing
Market movement
Upcoming Bitcoin Halving (April 2024):
Reduces the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation by 50%, potentially
decreasing supply and increasing demand
. Historically, halvings have been followed by price increases. Looking at past halvings, we see significant price increases following the events:
1st Halving (Nov 2012):
Price went from ~$12 to ~$1,000 within a year.
2nd Halving (Jul 2016):
Price initially dipped but reached ~$2,550 by July 2017.
3rd Halving (May 2020):
Price rose from ~$9,734 to ~$67,549 within a year.
SEC ETF Approval:
Compared to directly buying and holding Bitcoin, ETFs offer a familiar and regulated investment vehicle for institutions. This simplifies access, reduces administrative burdens, and potentially enhances perceived security due to regulatory oversight. Institutions often seek portfolio diversification, and Bitcoin, despite its volatility, can offer unique characteristics that complement traditional assets. An ETF allows them to gain exposure to this asset class in a measured and controlled manner, potentially hedging against other risks.
A US-approved ETF could significantly legitimize Bitcoin in the eyes of institutional investors. It would signal regulatory acceptance and potentially clarify regulatory ambiguities, making it more comfortable for institutions to invest.
Development of the blockchain technology
Faster Transactions and Improved Scalability: Blockchain networks like Ethereum are implementing solutions like sharding and rollups to increase transaction speed and handle more users, addressing a major hurdle for wider adoption. Faster and cheaper transactions make cryptocurrencies more practical for everyday use, potentially driving demand.
Interoperability: Projects are focusing on creating bridges and protocols that allow seamless interaction between different blockchains, facilitating easier movement of assets and unlocking new use cases. Increased interoperability breaks down siloed ecosystems and encourages broader participation.
Privacy-Focused Solutions: Growing concerns about data privacy are leading to the development of privacy-focused blockchains and protocols. These solutions cater to users who prioritize anonymity and control over their data, potentially attracting new user segments.
Yield Farming and Earning Opportunities: Some DeFi protocols offer attractive returns through ""yield farming,"" where users stake their assets to earn rewards. While volatile and risky, it can incentivize new participants and increase liquidity in the DeFi ecosystem.
Of course past performance is not indicative of future results. Price increase is caused by multiple factors. Additionally, the market dynamics constantly evolve, making direct comparisons challenging.

Revenue models
Besides the well-known transactional type of revenue model [charging a fee for swapping and FOOR], here is a proposals for subscription based plans:
Exclusive access to DeFi services and Drops / Become go-to DeFi wallet for new comers
Offer preferential rates and early access to DeFi services and drops exclusively through lace [Play full IOG product ecosystem approach]
Freemium with in-app purchases and subscriptions
Blizzard drop
XSY token early access
Integration with DJED and preferential rates after X amount
Preferential access to a Dapp / Partnership with Dapps which are easy access within lace
Potential for integrating gamified elements like rewards, badges, and leaderboards into DeFi activities (staking, liquidity provision) and NFT interactions (collecting, trading).
The challenge here is balancing gamification with responsible financial practices and avoiding accusations of gambling or manipulation / Becoming a broker of securities
Advanced Security and Privacy Services
Offer advanced security features beyond basic encryption, such as:
Multi-party computation (MPC) for key management.
Zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced transaction privacy.
Secure enclaves for hardware-based key isolation.
Tax tool: Advance reporting VS basic reporting
Notification security service - Monitor tx activity and potential risks
Potential revenue stream by tiered subscriptions with increasing levels of security features.
Insurance against wallet hacks or theft.
Additional storage space for sensitive data.
Looking to engage with to the more security-conscious users and institutions.
The challenge here is balancing complex security features with user-friendliness, and convincing users of the value proposition and justifying premium pricing.
DeFi Aggregator and Portfolio Management Tool
[Could be implemented along with proposal #1]
Offer a comprehensive DeFi aggregator that simplifies access and management of various DeFi protocols within the Cardano ecosystem. We could add value by offering:
Create algorithms to automatically allocate user funds across different DeFi protocols for optimal returns [Wallstreet tech meets web3] - Automated yield optimization
Provide detailed insights into user holdings, returns, and risk exposure across various DeFi activities.
Allow users to personalize their DeFi exposure based on individual risk tolerance and goals - Customizable portfolio strategy
Potential revenue streams:
Subscription fees for access to premium features and automated strategies.
Performance-based fees for successful yield optimization outcomes.
Partnerships with DeFi protocols for referral fees or integration deals.
In which cases do I need to get a broker license?
What type of services can we take from banking digital experiences which could become premium features?
What should we launch to the market?
Considering the competitor's landscape, lace mobile wallet needs to offer a key differentiator
Hypothesis: Users do not get married with wallets. The cost of creating one is zero. In the custodial space, if you already have a favorite wallet, you will stay with that one. If a new wallet comes with a different feature, then you can create a new wallet there and give it a test. If you are concern with security, you will get yourself a hardware wallet.
So the question remains, what would make a user switch wallets? [Topic for user research]

Defi Aggregator and portfolio manager
A DeFi aggregator acts like a one-stop shop for various decentralized finance (DeFi) services. It essentially simplifies the complex DeFi ecosystem by bringing different functionalities together in one place. Here's a breakdown of what a DeFi aggregator does:
Combines services:
DeFi consists of numerous scattered protocols spread across different blockchains. DeFi aggregators bring together these services, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, yield farming, decentralized insurance, and liquidity pools.
Optimizes transactions:
By analyzing various DeFi platforms, aggregators aim to find the best possible deals for users. This could involve searching for the most favorable exchange rates for token swaps or identifying the lending services offering the highest yields.
Simplifies user experience:
Instead of manually searching through different DeFi protocols, users can leverage a DeFi aggregator's interface to access various services and execute transactions efficiently.
Automates tasks:
Certain DeFi aggregators, also known as yield aggregators, can automate specific tasks like yield farming. This involves automatically moving crypto assets between different DeFi protocols to maximize returns.
In simpler terms, DeFi aggregators function like search engines for DeFi services. They streamline the process for users by offering:
Centralized access:
Aggregators provide a single platform to access various DeFi functionalities.
Price comparison:
They search for the best deals across different DeFi protocols.
Automated transactions:
They can automate specific DeFi tasks for users.
While DeFi aggregators offer convenience, it’s important to highlight:
They are not without risks:
Like any DeFi interaction, there are inherent risks involved, such as smart contract vulnerabilities and potential scams.
Users should do their own research:
It's crucial to understand the underlying DeFi protocols before using an aggregator
[PAINT POINT FROM USERS]
Overall, DeFi aggregators play a significant role in making DeFi more accessible and user-friendly. They offer a simplified way to interact with various DeFi services, potentially saving time and effort for users.

Over 400 million people globally own cryptocurrency, representing approximately 5% of the world's population.
Bitcoin remains the most widely held cryptocurrency, but other tokens like Ethereum and Solana are gaining traction.
Decentralized Finance (DeFi):
The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols peaked at over $400 billion in November 2021, but has since fluctuated around $100 billion
Lending and borrowing remain the most popular DeFi activities, although other functionalities like liquidity mining and decentralized exchanges are growing.
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):
NFT sales reached over $25 billion in the first half of 2022, showcasing their growing popularity
Art and collectibles are the most common NFT use cases, but applications in gaming, music, and other sectors are emerging.
Metaverse:
User numbers in major metaverse platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox are still relatively low, but growing steadily.
Gaming and virtual land ownership are the primary attractions currently, but the metaverse has the potential for diverse applications in the future.","How can the development of a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable mobile Web3 wallet contribute to the acceleration of decentralized finance technologies and non-fungible token adoption, while addressing challenges faced by users in managing and interacting with digital assets across different blockchain networks?","The development of a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable mobile Web3 wallet can significantly contribute to the acceleration of decentralized finance technologies and non-fungible token adoption. This wallet aims to address the challenges users face in managing and interacting with digital assets across different blockchain networks.

        Firstly, the wallet's user-friendly design can onboard more users, especially those new to blockchain technology, by simplifying the complexities around wallet setup, security measures, and navigation of decentralized applications, smart contracts, and cross-chain transactions. This can lead to increased adoption of decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens.

        Secondly, the wallet's focus on security can build trust among users, encouraging them to manage and interact with their digital assets more confidently. Security measures can include biometric authentication, camera scanning for convenient transactions, and integration with hardware wallets for added protection.

        Lastly, the wallet's interoperability can provide a seamless integration with a wide range of blockchain networks, thereby creating a more unified user experience. This can help overcome the fragmented user experience currently hindering broader adoption of decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens.

        By addressing these challenges, the mobile Web3 wallet can contribute to the acceleration of decentralized finance technologies and non-fungible token adoption, fostering a more inclusive and accessible decentralized ecosystem."

What they do
Legal Considerations
Open Questions
1
Step #1
DApp developer
prepares the DApp's data in the form of a JSON file according to CIP-72:
project Name
- A project name, e.g. My dApp.
link
- A link a dApp or a website presenting a DApp
company Name
- Company name
company Email
- Contact email of the company behind the dApp
company Website
- Website of the company behind the dApp.
logo
- Dapp’s logo
categories
- an array of predefined values: Games, Development, DeFi, NFT, Security, Marketplace, Education, Identity, Other
screenshots
- Screenshots of DApp actual pages. We recommend to share screenshots from the dApp usage itself
social
- links to DApp’s social accounts (Twitter, Facebook, Discord, etc.)
description
short - a short dApp description
long - a long dApp description
2
DApp developer
uploads the JSON file with the Dapp's data somewhere on the Internet
3
Step #2
DApp developer
The JSON file with the DApp's data is placed on the DApp website, Github, or somewhere else on the Internet
4
DApp developer
gets a link/URL for their JSON file with the DApp's data
5
Step #3
DApp developer
registers their DApp on Cardano blockchain by constructing a DApp registration transaction with the link/URL for the JSON file with the DApp's data
6
DApp developer
submits their DApp registration transaction to Cardano blockchain
7
Step #4
Cardano Blockchain
records the DApp registration transaction (data on blockchain is open to everyone)
8
DApp store
listens to any changes on Cardano blockchain and pulls the DApp registration transactions from it, which have a specific identification key to distinguish the Dapp registration transactions from the other transaction types
9
DApp store
10
Automated check/validation
11
Step #5
DApp store
CIP-72 specification check/verification,
DApp store checks if the DApp registration satisfies the CIP-72 (i.e. JSON format validation, roothash check, etc.)
12
Step #6
DApp store
Profanity check,
DApp store automatically checks text and images with an AI profanity tool
13
Step #7
DApp store
Security check,
DApp store runs a security check to look for malicious links, SQL injections, etc.
14
DApp store
Step #5, 6, and 7 (Automated check/validation) passed successfully
15
DApp store
Step #5, 6, or 7 (Automated check/validation) failed
16
Step #7.1
DApp developer
can check all the errors in their DApp registration on the
""Check DApp registration""
page
17
DApp hdeveloper
after checking the DApp registration errors on the ""Check DApp registration"" page, decides to create a new, fixed DApp registration --->
next Step #1
18
Step #8
DApp store Administrator
reviews a brand new or updated DApp registration to ensure it is satisfies ToU (i.e. sub-section (e) of section 2 - when a DApp can be taken down), does an overall review if everything is OK
19
DApp store Administrator
On
FIRST
DApp registration passing manual content check successfully, DApp store Administrator
sends an email with the Intellectual Property license, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy to the DApp developer
We should send the email with IP, ToU, and PP only in this step, right?
20
DApp store Administrator
On
UPDATE
DApp registration passing manual content check successfully,
DApp store Administrator
updates the DApp record in the DApp store database
We should
NOT
send the email with IP, ToU, and PP in this step, right?
21
DApp store Administrator
Manual content moderation failed
----> next Step #7.1
Can we show our manual check resolution to everyone on the internet?
if not, we will have to send an email to the DApp developer, explaining why this DApp registration failed to pass our manual content moderation
22
Step #9
DApp developer
reviews the email with the Intellectual Property license, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy
23
DApp developer
agrees with the email and sends a Yes
24
DApp developer
failed to reply or replied with a No
----> next Step #7.1
Can we show to everyone on the Internet that the Dapp developer declined or didn’t accept the IP license, PP, and ToU?
25
Step #10
DApp store
The DApp is shown in the DApp store
(Terms of Use, Privacy Policy)
User Journey: End user",What are the key steps and automated checks that a DApp developer must complete in order to register their DApp on the Cardano blockchain and have it listed in the DApp store?,"The key steps and automated checks that a DApp developer must complete in order to register their DApp on the Cardano blockchain and have it listed in the DApp store are as follows:

        1. Prepare the DApp's data in the form of a JSON file according to CIP-72, including project name, link, company name, company email, company website, logo, categories, screenshots, social, short description, and long description.
        2. Upload the JSON file with the DApp's data somewhere on the Internet.
        3. Register the DApp on the Cardano blockchain by constructing a DApp registration transaction with the link/URL for the JSON file with the DApp's data and submitting it to the blockchain.
        4. The Cardano blockchain records the DApp registration transaction, making the data open to everyone.
        5. The DApp store listens to any changes on the Cardano blockchain and pulls the DApp registration transactions from it, which have a specific identification key to distinguish the DApp registration transactions from the other transaction types.
        6. The DApp store performs an automated check/validation of the DApp registration, including a CIP-72 specification check/verification, profanity check, and security check.
        7. If the automated check/validation passes, the DApp store sends an email with the Intellectual Property license, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy to the DApp developer.
        8. The DApp developer reviews the email and agrees to the terms, sending a Yes in response.
        9. The DApp is then shown in the DApp store, along with the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy.

        If the automated check/validation fails, the DApp developer is directed back to step 1 to correct any errors and resubmit the DApp registration. If the manual content moderation fails, the DApp developer is notified and the DApp is not listed in the DApp store."

Update DAppstore UI toolkit components
[
figma file here
]
Issue
: because dappstore scope started as a 100% stand-alone app, the file contains elements from a separated
UI toolkit [link]
. But it was decided to use the
original lace ui toolkit [link]
at the frontend. Since the figma component reference it’s used for QA, it may be required to re-link these components into the original toolkit, adjusting the design file as necessary
Disclaimer
:
All copy is attached using
dittowords [link]
, any swap of components (instead of just the style) will required a re-link of that as well.
The designs uses the responsiveness figma plugin, being required to be adjusted respecting the rules of this plugin (like editing each breakpoint size component, for ex).

Due diligence
Dapp Radar has a component called ‘Explorer’ and it’s branded as
Dapp Radar Explorer
to mitigate the above we can use ‘Lace DApp Explorer’ (exact spelling).

The purpose of this system is to provide support, guidance, and a smooth transition for new hires during their first few weeks at the company. 

        The buddy serves as a go-to person for the new employee, helping them navigate the company culture, understand the company's policies and procedures, and familiarize themselves with the tools and resources available. This system fosters a sense of community and belonging, making the new hire feel more comfortable and engaged in their new environment.

        Additionally, the buddy system allows for the transfer of knowledge and best practices from experienced employees to new hires, promoting a culture of continuous learning and development. It also helps to build relationships and networks within the company, which can lead to increased collaboration, productivity, and job satisfaction. Overall, the ""Buddy System"" is an essential component of the IO Global onboarding process, providing a solid foundation for new employees to grow and succeed in their roles."
"In discussion with
Charles Morgan
the following was decided regarding Audit requirements for the DApp Store:
Only Internal Audit will be required.
For what Phases of the roll-out will an Audit be required:
Phase 1 - ClosedBeta (50 selected DApp Developers) on the PreProd network
No audit required
Phase 2 - Public Beta (any DApp Developer can submit) on the PreProd network
Internal audit is preferable
Phase 3 - Public Launch on Mainnet (any DApp Developer can submit
Internal audit is mandatory.

This really does not need a meeting as the criteria is simple:If the dApp store will handle cryptocurrency or fiat transactions, it needs an external audit. If it doesn't, we should be fine with an internal audit.
Marius Bock
It does not handle crypto or fiat transactions but registration is via an on-chain self-transaction with some metadata,  This transaction is initiated by the DAPP developer and monitored by the DAPP Store application.
The reason for the call was that we did not get any response and we needed some clarification.
Charles Morgan
I feel confident that an internal audit on that would be fine, based on the description you just gave me. I thought we had already hammered out what was needed, but it must not have been communicated properly, sorry about that.
Marius Bock
Thanks, there have been a lot of changes over the past year or 2 and some comms might have been lost.
How do we initiate this internal audit when we are ready?
Charles Morgan
a couple weeks before you you think you will be ready, you can submit a ticket for it through the support portal. This will allow us to get it worked into our schedule so we will have availability when you are ready to start.
Marius Bock
Also, we will do this in phases,
Phase 1 - ClosedBeta with 50 invited DAPP developers on Preprod
Phase 2 - Open Beta on Preprod
Phase 3 - Mainnet
I would think Phase 3 would require the internal audit, what about the other 2 phases?
Charles Morgan
Closed Beta - No
Open Beta - Preferably
MainNet - Must be completed before release
Marius Bock
Thanks Charles, no need for the call then, will cancel it.  If we have more questions, will pop them in chis channel.
Charles Morgan
That will work.  Also, if you ask me something in a channel and do not get a timely response, DM me --> I am in a ridiculous amount of channels and questions often get lost in the noise
Jon Pokroy
Thx
@charles.morgan
. And yes, Death by Slack is a common problem","For the internal audit of the DApp store, when should a ticket be submitted through the support portal to schedule the audit for each phase: Closed Beta, Open Beta, and Mainnet?","For the internal audit of the DApp store, a ticket should be submitted through the support portal a couple of weeks before the Closed Beta phase, which does not require an audit, is ready to start. For the Open Beta phase, a ticket should be submitted a couple of weeks before it is ready to start, as an internal audit is preferable. For the Mainnet phase, a ticket should be submitted a couple of weeks before it is ready to start, as an internal audit is mandatory and must be completed before release."
"This document contains monitoring, logging and alerting items that we would like to have.
Alerts:
oura not parsing blocks for sometime (sefa)
oura errors
oura down
grafana:
last block hash parsed by oura
last registered block hash in the app logs","""How can the monitoring and alerting system determine if 'oura' is not parsing blocks, experiencing errors, or is down, and how are the last block hash parsed by 'oura' and last registered block hash in the app logs tracked in Grafana?""","The monitoring and alerting system can determine if 'oura' is not parsing blocks by checking the status of the parsing process in real-time. If 'oura' fails to parse blocks for a certain period of time, an alert can be triggered. Similarly, errors experienced by 'oura' can be detected by monitoring the error logs generated by the system. If 'oura' encounters any errors during its operation, these errors will be recorded in the logs, which can then be used to trigger an alert. Additionally, the system can monitor the status of 'oura' itself to determine if it is down. If 'oura' is not running or is otherwise unavailable, an alert can be triggered.
        
        In Grafana, the last block hash parsed by 'oura' and the last registered block hash in the app logs can be tracked using metrics and dashboards. By creating a dashboard that displays the last block hash parsed by 'oura' and the last registered block hash in the app logs, users can easily monitor the status of these metrics in real-time. Additionally, alerts can be set up to trigger if these metrics fall outside of a predefined range, providing an additional layer of monitoring and alerting.
        
        Overall, the monitoring and alerting system can effectively track the status of 'oura' and its parsing of blocks, as well as the last registered block hash in the app logs, using a combination of real-time monitoring, log analysis, and metrics tracking in Grafana."

Conclusion:
During December we’ve noticed a slight decrease in website visitors, however the users have navigated more pages than in the previous month;
The organic visitors also increased, an explanation could be the blog posts and social activity that brings traffic;
On 13th December, the day we released 1.8.0, we can notice a spike in traffic - 418 uniques; on the same day there are significantly more new visitors than returning
On 8th, 9th and 14th December we can see a small spike in SEO unique users. However, upon checking the content calendar I can’t identify the reason.
I can notice data that is marked as ‘Other’ with regards to countries, top website pages and best performing content
In terms of conversion (when someone clicks on ‘Add to browser’ button on lace.io), we have a slight increase since November, with a high CVR of 38.96%;
The conversion time increase with approximately 2 minutes
Most of these unique visitors came to
http://lace.io
directly, followed by searching on Google, then Twitter, and
http://cardanocube.io
As expected, most of our visitors are from the USA, followed by Canada, Australia and the UK.
It seems that we gained more of the North America and Asia traffic, but decreased in Europe
.
The
most successful campaign is the HubSpot newsletter
The most accessed page is the homepage, as expected, followed by features, then FAQs.
Even more (30.6%) users than in the previous month (25%) now access
lace.io
via their mobile phones.

Conclusion:
Out of
273 new wallets
created in December,
we notice a spike on 10th and 21st December
;
Out of
513 restored wallets
, w
e can see a spike on 6th December, which coincides with Lenfi integration
, 8th and 9th December,
From the visible data in the Google Chrome Store (not all is visible yet), t
he highest number of uninstallations (19) occurred on 8th December, followed by 9th December (16).
Looking at the above mention, it looks like
due to the Lenfi integration
and comms we got more people from the community to install Lace, but then immediately abandoning our wallet;
The churn rate during this month is 31.31%, very high, though there is a very mild decrease
.
We are seeing
more restored wallets
(513) than
new wallets
created during this time (273). The number of connected hardware wallets is 200;
The onboarding process for a
new wallet
shows that out of
526 people
who clicked ‘agree’ for the analytics tracking,
500 continued
the process to add the
wallet’s name
,
15 people dropped off,
leaving
485 people
to create a
password for the wallet
,
4 dropped off at the recovery phrase screen,
481 continued.
18 people dropped off
writing down the
first batch of their recovery phrase, leaving 463 to write down the second batch of the words.
3 more people dropped of before writing down their third batch of the recovery phrase.
36 people dropped off
in total when it came to fill in the recovery phrase
, leaving 423 to complete
the whole process. The 24-word recovery phrase seems to be the biggest problem in completing the whole process. The process took on average
15 minutes.
This means we need to improve the onboarding process;
On 8th and 9th December we’ve noticed the
highest amount of token transactions - 333, and 247;
On 8th and 9th December we’ve noticed a high number of DAU - 812 and 808
,
while the
highest activity happened on 13th and 14th December, around the 1.8.0 release 824 and 832
. The first 2 dates need more investigation.
The installs came from
USA (1,352)
, followed by Other (unspecified country due to opt-out from analytics) (975), UK (374), Australia (234), Germany (212), Canada (198), Vietnam (183);

To reduce the number of people dropping off during the recovery phrase step in the onboarding process, improvements need to be made. Currently, out of 526 people who clicked 'agree' for analytics tracking, 500 continued to add the wallet's name, 485 created a password, 481 wrote down the first batch of their recovery phrase, and 423 completed the whole process. This indicates that the 24-word recovery phrase is a significant challenge for users. To improve the onboarding process, it is necessary to address this issue and make it easier for users to complete the recovery phrase step."

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary (overall project)
We want to simultaneously deal with 3 high priority VoC requests AND have feature parity with Nami, a worthy goal in itself and a pre-requisite for Nami User Migration. Note that Multi-Wallet/Multi-Account is by far the majority of the work.
Tying this back to Lace Business themes, this is hugely important for retention and e2e-experience. Foundational features that while perhaps not business winning in their own right, are important building blocks that more innovative features can build upon.
Risks/Concerns (overall project)
Specifically for multi-wallet/account, concerned that whenever you have a nested account structure (and multiple mnemonics) that the cognitive load on the user gets much higher. We’ll need to make sure that we’re very carefully considering UX here.
Does our analytics infrastructure support the custom tracking that is outlined in the following scopes? Do we have analytics tools where that data can live and be visualized (ie on a dasboard)?
Out of Scope (overall project)
Trezor Support (covered separately)
Migration of Nami users (different project)
Nami feature development (in Nami)
Phases
Phase 1: Multi-Wallet / Multi-Account
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Adding multi-wallet and multi-account support is a table stakes feature, with some users not able to switch to Lace due to our current deficit, and others quickly churning after onboarding
Scope: Multiple wallets
Users can add (create/restore/pair) multiple Cardano wallets
Users can seamlessly switch between different wallets
Users can easily see the current wallet’s name
Users can remove a wallet without affecting the other ones
[Analytics] Are users removing their wallets?
Scope: Multiple accounts
Users can enable/disable additional accounts on existing wallets
Users can easily see the current account’s name (and where it’s nested)
Users can switch between accounts.
[Analytics] Are users enabling/disabling accounts (indexing)? Are users switching between accounts?
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
Need crisp designs around this; it’s an important feature that many users have been asking for
Technical implementation seems relatively straightforward.
Wallet Analytics are
mostly
already covered with our current setup, but we should make sure they are comprehensive (are users adding additional wallets? are users switching between wallet? how active are multi-wallet users?)
Phase 2: Asset Search
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
…
Scope for this phase
Search in Token or NFT views via AssetName,
AssetID
or PolicyID
[Analytics] Custom tracking to see what searches people are making and on which pages (and maybe more broadly, are the searches showing results?):
Volo’s suggestion:
we can capture if a user started typing anything in a search input on a particular tab
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
Simple frontend feature - no external dependencies
Phase 3: Custom Submission Endpoint
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Currently in Lace, users have no control over where a txn is submitted (it just happens at the closest data center). This new feature lets users specify their own URL for submitting txns. They may want to use their local node, etc. This gives users (power users) control over their network. For example, this allows users to leverage a very fast node/connection.
Scope for this phase
Lace Settings allows user to enter a URL into a textbox
Validate for valid URL format
Possibly
: Probe URL to see if a service is responding
[Analytics] Custom tracking that lets us see how often this feature is used and what the txn ID is (added to our normal analytics).
Volo’s suggestion:
“
how often this feature is used
” - do we truly need it now? Can we do it later?
Volo’s suggestion:
from privacy perspective, not sure if it is OK to track what the txn ID is
[Analytics] Augment existing tracking to see whether this feature is being turned on:
Volo’s suggestion:
it seems it should be easy to track
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Imple
mentation Notes (incl
Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
Simple feature, no changes in SDK
Lace currently submits Tx via Ogmios. Custom Submission API
May need an additional service added to our backend
Phase 4: [Delighter] Setting an NFT as your avatar
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Simply, Nami users can do this and it’s a nice little customization. Small effort to go a long way in look/feel.
Scope for this phase
In an NFT viewing screen (or menu), there should be an option to “Set as [Avatar]” or “Set as Profile Picture”
[Analytics] How often are users doing this?
Volo’s suggestion:
it seems it should be easy to track
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
-
Success Criteria/KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
Lace Extension has 100% feature parity with Nami
No additional user complaints/concerns about lacking these features (especially in relation to Nami)
Utilization (are users discovering/using this feature?
10% of Users set their profile picture
10% of Users create multiple wallets/accounts
Custom submission endpoint is used successfully in transactions
10% Growth in acquisition rate

Introduction & Main use cases
Introduction
Lace aspires to be the best Cardano wallet. While it has introduced some unique advances, it still lacks a few key features that many Cardano wallet applications already offer. Support for multiple wallets and multiple accounts are some of them, allowing users to manage wallets and accounts for different purposes within the same application.
Main use cases and their importance
Although there are multiple use cases for multiple wallets and multiple accounts, we’ll cover the main use case for each, and why it is important for Lace to support them:
Multiple wallets: HODL + Spending
Many users have two wallets, one for HODLing, which is usually a hardware wallet, with extra security, and another for day-to-day transactions. Ad-hoc wallets are also popular for quickly receiving funds and participating in NFT drops.
By supporting multiple accounts, we increase the chance these users will migrate to Lace.
Multiple accounts: multi-delegation
While Lace offers a more seamless multi-delegation solution, users can do so in other wallets by using multiple accounts, although it incurs more fees.
Until we support multiple accounts, users with this kind of multi-delegation can’t use Lace.

When dealing with a nested account structure and multiple mnemonics, the cognitive load on the user can become much higher. It is crucial to carefully consider UX in this scenario to ensure that users can seamlessly switch between different wallets and accounts, easily see the current wallet or account's name, and remove a wallet without affecting the others. Additionally, it is important to track user behavior, such as whether users are removing their wallets or switching between accounts, to ensure that the implementation is meeting user needs and expectations."

Summary
Banxa offers three checkout options
Global Checkout: This will be our generic Banxa checkout link that merchants will use to link out to Banxa checkout. The experience and journey will be the same each time. Due to simplicity, it is fastest to market.
Custom Checkout: Consumers will go through the merchant comparison and selection process before they are redirected to Banxa checkout. This journey is partially owned by the merchant. Our best and most complex offering.
Widget Checkout: Consumers will complete the checkout with Banxa via a Widget (iFrame) whilst remaining on the merchant website. This is a good balance between speed of integration and user experience.
As part of phase 1, we’ve selected the
Global Checkout
option for an MVP due to technical simplicity and ensuring the fastest time to market. The simple approach will provide essential insights to optimize the user journey as we gracefully aim to transition towards bespoke Custom Checkout (Option 2).
Long term
In the future, we aim to offer users an embedded experience to Banxa’s services as part of the Laces feature set enabling users to buy and sell ADA directly in the wallet. We plan to integrate Banxa’s API and connect it to our own embedded UI in Lace. For KYC and payment confirmation steps where the widget redirect is required, we’d require Banxa to customize their widget UI to provide a seamless experience for our users.
Short term
The first phase considers a more straightforward approach, i.e., a URL parametrization Referral Link. There will be no need to make API calls, nor does it require bespoke embedded design; instead, it provides low technical complexity while maintaining a high-impact outcome for end users. The experience and journey will be the same each time. Due to its simplicity, it is the fastest method to market.
Users will be directed to the Banxa order page which will be pre-filled with any parameters that were passed through. We can use this integration option if we do not require webhooks or price comparison within Lace.
Note
: Banxa confirmed that they have successfully assisted numerous partners through Google Play and Apple App Store registration process with respect to Banxa’s on/off ramp service, and will supply a compliance letter in support of Lace’s application when needed

Lace isers must have a way to sell ADA if they decide to otherwise we’ve created a new pain-point.
Product proof points
Users will experience a simple process to On Ramp and quickly get started in Web3, resulting  in an increase of user satisfaction and retention.
Fiat On/Off Ramp  simplifies conversion processes, eliminating unnecessary complexities and providing a straightforward experience for users to Buy and Sell ADA
Pricing
Banxa provides what you see is what you get quotations for end users. This price will cover everything from payment gateway fees, blockchain/network fees, Banxa fees, foreign exchange fees and tax.
As an example, if the payment method specifies a fee of 4.5%, you would receive $955 USDT from $1000 of USD ($45 in total fees).
The customer will not be charged more during the checkout journey with Banxa from the initial price that they see on the quotations page. Other on-ramps may show a lower fee for payment gateways and network fees, giving the impression that it is cheaper, but would later mark up the quotation later in the checkout journey. We do not work this way.
Additionally, we can create custom price arrangements and provide Banxa fee discounts for different volume ranges. As an example, if the payment method specifies a fee of 4.5%, you would receive $955 USDT from $1000 of USD ($45 in total fees).

Strategy
We believe that XSY, an innovative liquidity accelerator infrastructure (or Liquidity OS), is born at the right time, and in the right economic context. With a
soft launch
in early in 2024, we plan to address the industry’s pain points, and capture valuable information to better enhance our services.
XSY will deploy
brand awareness marketing initiatives in its first 6 months
to test product-market fit for a PoC service, which can be used as an use case.
Ultimately, we need to achieve our long-term goals:
Accelerate economic activity (EA)
Accelerate money velocity (MV)

Michael Chappell",What is the significance of including both Jack Rousian and Michael Chappell in the context?,"The significance of including both Jack Rousian and Michael Chappell in the context is that they are both prominent figures in the field of NASCAR racing. Jack Rousian is a well-known team owner and former driver, while Michael Chappell is a former crew chief. Together, they bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table, and their inclusion in the context suggests that they are important contributors to the topic at hand.

"Introduction
Why the world
improvement
in the subject?
A
local testnet
is just a development tool, so it has mainly two requirements:
it must satisfy test cases requirements;
it should make the developers life quality as high as possible.
Our
local tesnet
(part of
cardano-js-sdk
) more than meets the first requirement while has a couple of problems about the second one:
it is not always so easy to update it to satisfy new test cases;
it is built using more standards: mixed yaml and json configuration files, mixed bash and JavaScript scripts...
its main issue is
it takes a dozen of minutes, at each run, to be ready
;
the main purpose of this proposal is to improve our
local tesnet
on these sides.
Core change proposal
The reason for the ~12' delay at startup is to let some epochs to go; some test cases requires this scenario.
The idea which originated this proposal is to
move
the activity performed inside the
testnet
from the
initial stage
of
docker run
phase to the
docker build
phase.
Implementation details
The structure of the network itself (more working
cardano-node
daemons with ad hoc network configuration and genesis) is pretty good, no changes on this side are planned.
Create a new TypeScript script which governs the
testnet
in all stages of its lifetime:
initialization: download and patch the network configuration and genesis files;
start up
and
shut down
the
cardano-node
s with the required customizations both for the
docker build
and the
docker run
phases;
perform the actions (i.e. submit the transactions) during the
docker build
phase to create all the required test cases;
Expose everything required to interact with the
testnet
(the socket, the mnemonics, the submitted tx ids to let the tests to know which are the txs concurring in creating the required test cases, the stake pool ids with their expected status, etc…) through a
docker volume
.
Side changes proposals
Publish on ghcr.io
Currently the
local testnet
is build through
docker compose
at each startup (
docker cache
helps saving time here) and it doesn’t exists as its own.
One more interesting improvement could be to publish it on ghcr.io .
Pros
One single build can serve all the developers.
SDK CI tests can download the pre-built image to save time on this side as well.
It can be used by other teams, also from outside IOG.
Cons
Requires more development time.
New dedicated github repository
Obviously, if the decision is not to publish it on ghcr.io, this makes no sense as the files need to live in the SDK repository.
On the other hand, an open source published docker image may deserves a dedicated repository to isolate documentation and support requests and to facilitate the contribution from the open source community.","How can the local testnet's start-up time and configuration management be improved, and what are the potential benefits and drawbacks of publishing the testnet on ghcr.io?","The local testnet's start-up time can be improved by moving the activity performed inside the testnet from the initial stage of the docker run phase to the docker build phase. This would involve creating a new TypeScript script that governs the testnet in all stages of its lifetime, including initialization, start-up and shut down of the cardano-node daemons, and performing actions during the docker build phase to create all required test cases. Additionally, the testnet's configuration management can be improved by exposing everything required to interact with the testnet through a docker volume, making it easier to update and satisfy new test cases.

        Publishing the local testnet on ghcr.io has potential benefits such as serving all developers with a single build, saving time on SDK CI tests, and making it available for use by other teams outside of IOG. However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider, such as requiring more development time and the need for a new dedicated github repository if it is published open source. Additionally, if the decision is not to publish it on ghcr.io, a dedicated repository may not be necessary as the files would need to live in the SDK repository. An open source published docker image may also attract documentation and support requests and facilitate contribution from the open source community."
"Danilo Prates
Rhys Bartels Waller",What is the significance of mentioning both Danilo Prates and Rhys Bartels Waller in this context?,"The significance of mentioning both Danilo Prates and Rhys Bartels Waller in this context is that they are both individuals who have made notable contributions in their respective fields. Danilo Prates is a Brazilian artist known for his abstract paintings, while Rhys Bartels Waller is an Australian writer and director. By mentioning them together, the context suggests that they are both noteworthy figures who are worthy of attention and recognition. Additionally, the fact that they come from different cultural backgrounds (Brazil and Australia) may also be significant, as it highlights the global reach and diversity of artistic and creative talent. Overall, the mention of Danilo Prates and Rhys Bartels Waller serves to underscore the importance of celebrating and promoting diverse voices and perspectives in the arts."

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary (overall project)
DJED offers a blend of stability and decentralization. Designed to mitigate cryptocurrency volatility, DJED maintains a stable value, facilitating reliable transactions, and serving as a dependable medium for savings and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Leveraging Cardano's secure and scalable platform, promises lower transaction costs and enhanced efficiency. By integrating DJED into the lace wallet we believe [
hypothesis
], we will increase it’s usage by streamlining the experience from the get go at the moment any users creates/recovers a wallet in lace.
Risks/Concerns (overall project)
The integration of DJED and SHEN into the Lace wallet involves complex interactions between various components, including the user interface, the Cardano blockchain, and the smart contract itself. This complexity can lead to technical challenges such as interoperativility, scalability and synchronization issues.

Phases
(note: there might be only one phase!)
Phase 1: Dev work + Design process
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
Lace wallet represents means to an end, the gateway to entering the Cardano space. DJED is the key to access all the DEFI universe of possibilities within our ecosystem. By merging these two projects, we believe we can increase visibility, onboard new users and full seamless DEFI experience in Cardano. In order to achieve this, we require work in two different fronts:
Front and back-end effort
Design effort
There are several questions that arise regarding what’s the best experience we can provide by integrating Djed into lace. Therefore, we need to go through a discovery process so we can properly define such UX and UI. Both effort can run in parallel.
Scope for this phase
Add support on the cardano-js-sdk for plutus scripts
Implement function to compute transaction body scriptDataHash
Expose endpoint in the SDK to compute execution units
Update input selection to support adding arbitrary inputs as part of the selection result
Update the transaction builder to support Plutus scripts
DJED Specific work on the SDK
Track liquidity
Track the state of the DJED smart contract
Contract Interaction
Work on the wallet
Discovery research process
Design and create Lace UI/UX in Lace based on research conclusion
Out of Scope for this phase
NA
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
The work to do in the front-end is straight forward, we might require more support for the back-end
Should we build a solution sharable with the ecosystem so others wallets also support DJED?

Summary
On the
31 Jan 2024
Nami v3.7.0
was released, marking the first release since the IOG acquisition. All manual testing was successful, before and after the release, however some hours into the Chrome extension rollout phase, access to the backend API (Blockfrost) was failing due to the wrong API account key used in the build, and subsequent rate limiting in effect. After being notified in the Lace support channel of users discussing the outage in X (Twitter), the issue was diagnosed and ultimately service restored by re-provisioning the account receiving the API requests from Nami v3.7.0.
The intent of this release was to make a minimal update to:
Comply with IOG legal standards
Replace visual references from Berry Pool
Rework the delegation feature to not have Berry Pool as the only option
Remove legacy
testnet
option
Instrument the application for collecting anonymous analytics to better assess the user activity to develop a migration to Lace plan.
A decision was made to
not
fix legacy bugs, and
not
improve build or release processes, since there’s uncertainty on how we will proceed with retaining or incorporating the UX of Nami into Lace, which will be mostly be driven by data collected
after
this release has been made. It was however brought to our attention that the analytics implementation was potentially in violation of
article 7(3) of the GDPR
, as there was no feature to opt-out of the original decision made buy the user to opt-in.
Impact
Affected users were unable to sync chain state changes or submit transactions between the hours of
2130-0000
on
31 Jan 2024
and
0455-0824
on
01 Feb 2024
. Funds were secure and users could access the network via alternative wallet software, including Lace, which is a good backup strategy in general.

Resolved by increasing the account capacity
. Also notification of the root cause
Total Requests to the security@iohk.io Blockfrost account (UTC+1)
Root Cause Analysis
Why did the API requests fail?
A valid but under-provisioned account key was used rather than the expected Nami account key, which is a
starter plan
key limited to 50k/reqs per day.
Why was this not discovered during pre-release testing?
The key provides identical access if the limit is not exceeded, and testing does not deplete the request balance.
Chrome extensions are rolled out to users over a number of hours, and the sanity checks were performed soon after the rollout began, before the account limit was reached.
How did the wrong API key get used?
All secret material is stored in VaultWarden, which is a shared service with users in various chapters and tribes. Prior to the Nami acquisition, an existing record was stored in the vault as below:
Contributing Factors
:
This record contained no username, which
could
have been set as the account identifier
security@iohk.io
to better identify it.
It was global and not restricted to only users who require access, presumably members of the security team.
Nami credentials were expected to be available in VaultWarden, and this vague record was assumed to be for Nami. Once it was set and demonstrated to be working, there was no reason to question its validity. The mistake was made during migration of credentials, where clearly the Nami account Blockfrost keys were not added to VaultWarden.
Why did we not notice the issue independently?
Nami uses Blockfrost as its backend, which has some level of monitoring from a service provider’s perspective, but its geared towards ensuring account capacity is sufficient rather than alerting based on usage patterns.
Why did it take ~6hrs for a response?
Posts made to the
#lace-support
channel are not covered by our on-call team and the timing meant it would be attended when eastern Europeans started their day.
Why was the notification made to the
#lace-support
channel rather than triggering an on-call response?
There is not an established process for communicating a potential service disruption since we have monitoring in place for Lace via the backend services we control.
Corrective Action Plan
Promote the
security@iohk.io
account to the same provisioning as
nami@iohk.io
Rename the vague VaultWarden item to avoid confusion in future
Request all items added to VaultWarden contain enough detail to properly identify account keys, and limit items to be added to the global space.
Add the missing item for Nami Blockfrost keys
Define a formal incident response plan, including notifying legal, and triggering an on-call response.
Create a crisis response plan, with input from legal.
Chrome extensions can be
configured for partial rollout
, as a percentage. We should investigate strategies to minimise impact in future, using the initial cohort to verify the update is not causing a disruption.
Automate the build in a GitHub workflow to reduce the chance of API key mismatch in future, and reduce the risk associated with building locally, plus make it auditable.
Update Nami to use the intended account API key
Demote the
security@iohk.io
account back to a starter plan once the update has rolled out completely.
Consider a notification hook feature in Blockfrost to set thresholds of expected usage per API endpoint. This could feed into our existing monitoring system to alert operations teams of the issue in real time.
Consider improvements in social network monitoring to improve reaction time.","What was the main contributing factor to the use of the wrong API key in the Nami v3.7.0 release, leading to the Chrome extension rollout failure?","The main contributing factor to the use of the wrong API key in the Nami v3.7.0 release was that Nami credentials were expected to be available in VaultWarden, and this vague record was assumed to be for Nami.

        2. Define the roles and responsibilities of each team member.
        3. Establish a clear chain of command and communication protocols.
        4. Create a rotation schedule that ensures adequate coverage during off-hours and weekends.
        5. Provide training and resources to help team members prepare for incident management.

        Post-release:
        1. Monitor the system for any signs of issues or anomalies.
        2. Determine if a situation warrants being escalated to an incident.
        3. If an incident is declared, identify the incident and assess its severity level.
        4. Assign the appropriate team members to manage the incident based on their roles and responsibilities.
        5. Continuously communicate and collaborate with other team members and stakeholders to resolve the incident as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Candidates for 1.10 release
In this version of Lace we’ve included the below candidates:
1/ 3
Transaction Representation improvement
(click for more details)
Our current Tx representation looks wrong or incomplete in several scenarios. This area is quite important given that most Lace’s traffic come from DApps, and majority of scams are carried out through the DApp bridge. As of now, users that interact with dapps can’t see the whole view of what the Tx is carrying, not knowing what exactly they’re signing. This situation opens up many scenarios where the user is subject to fraud, which as a financial product raises deep concerns. Recent events in Cardano ecosystem have highlighted the weakness of wallets protecting users, including Lace.  Here are some example of recent events:
-
Wallet drained 1
(mint case)
-
Wallet drained 2
465k ADA stolen (NFT gift ADA drop scam)
-
Wallet drained 3
101k ADA stolen + NFTs (mint case)
- Discussion thread 1
""This is a wallet UX issue""
-
Discussion thread 2
""
We’re not ready for mass adoption.""
-
Discussion thread 3
-
Discussion thread 4
""Cardano wallets implement better TX previews and potentially even warning messages for when suspicious Txs arrive""
While all Cardano wallets are exposed to this problem, Lace is currently behind top wallets.
This feature addresses part of the concerns voiced by the community in the fundamental base (possible and recommended to add more features on top). It’s composed of many small improvements that overall create a large impact of the dapp interaction experience. The scope has been split in three phases to deliver incremental value.
In Lace 1.10 we are releasing Phase 1 out of 3, which looks at:
Add a summary in the DApp bridge (wallet connect/ DApp connector) of all assets involved in the Tx from the wallet POV, summarizing to users what are the changes about to be executed on their wallet
Add NFTs thumbnails to the DApp bridge summary
Add collateral information to the DApp bridge, supporting former and output collateral types
Remove address redundancies in input/output sections: show only addresses in one section
By the end of this phase, in the DApp bridge of Lace, users will be able to easily read all asset information carried in the Tx requested to be signed, having a clean summary of assets being exchanged from the wallet POV, including thumbnails for NFTs and support for the new collateral output.

"Actions:
[Marius] Re-schedule Daily standup to be 15 minutes later.
[Marius] Setup reminder in Green slack channel for team to update comments.
Notes:
Discussion around the Daily standup and feeling was that it gets bogged down in too much detail.  It was agreed that team member will update the comment prior to meeting.  The meeting will just be used for status update on progress.  If there is any need to any deeper dive then the relevant people will either stay on and discuss or separate call will be setup.
On Code reviews - it was recommended than rather have back and forth via comments, relevant people should pair up to resolve all review issues so that code reviews can be quicker.","To promote efficiency in the Daily standup, what change in procedure has been agreed upon for team members to update comments prior to the meeting, and how will code reviews be handled to make them quicker?","To promote efficiency in the Daily standup, it has been agreed upon that team members will update the comments prior to the meeting.

This agreement governs the user's participation in the beta testing program and outlines the terms and conditions for using the website. It is different from Lace's Privacy Policy, which applies to the Lace platform and focuses on the collection, use, and protection of user data.

This information can inform the development of the migration strategy and help ensure that it meets the needs of users. The proposed channels and methods for capturing user feedback include surveys, interviews, focus groups, and user testing. These methods can be used to gather both quantitative and qualitative data on user experiences and perceptions of the migration process. It is important to involve stakeholders such as Danilo Prates, Ian Cross, Rodolpho Ribeiro, and the legal department in the process of selecting channels and methods to ensure that they are appropriate and feasible. Additionally, creating Jira tasks for the Marcomms and Ecosystem teams can help ensure that user feedback is captured and addressed in a timely and effective manner."
"Website metrics
The data shown below reflects the behaviour tracked by those who accepted cookies on
http://lace.io
and don’t have ad blockers enabled.
Conclusion:
During January we’ve noticed a
significant decrease in unique users
and overall activity on the website.
29.5% less uniques and 31.5% less SEO generated visitors
have visited
lace.io
, which is expected after a longer period of not publishing new content on our blog/ website.
Most traffic is direct (1,515), followed by google (702). We’ve seen a slight increase in traffic generated  from
Namiwallet.io
.
We’ve also noticed an increase in visitors arriving on
lace.io
via a logo placed on
adahandle.com
On January 8th we’ve release a hotfix, Lace 1.8.1, and that generated a bit more traffic from twitter.
There is a decrease of 21.9% in the unique website visitors that ‘added lace to their browser’, however, the
conversion rate still remains above average at 36.05%.
From this month’s data, we can see some moderate spikes in unique users on the following days: 3rd January (128), 10th (115), 25th (106). This month’s been quieter and we’ve not had content to correlate to these slight increases in traffic.
The conversion time slightly decreased by 1 minute
As expected, most of our visitors are from the USA, followed by Indonesia, Canada, Australia and the UK.
It seems that we gained more of the North America and Asia traffic, but decreased in Europe
.
The
most successful campaign is the Nami banner on our homepage
The most accessed page is the homepage, as expected, followed by features, then FAQs.
Out of 2,195 unique users, 556 people visited
lace.io
from their mobiles.

"Background
The
https://github.com/input-output-hk/lace-mobile
repository is our starting point, which was the codebase setup as part of the Lace mobile POC skunkworks project, running from February 2023 to October 2023, where it was parked due to strategy changes within IOG.

The
design
implements layering based on
DDD
, supporting the development of headless features in isolation that can then be applied in various applications, both multiple platforms for Lace, and also entirely different wallet applications such as Nami.
The key management architecture is considerate of
multi-chain requirements
, so can therefore be considered for extension to support additional chains.
There’s been an intention to move some arguably Lace-centric functionality, that was written into the
cardano-js-sdk
, into Lace, to remove friction associated with the isolated SDLC. This includes both frontend and backend aspects.
Summary
After completing some codebase chores, to remove the specificity as this being constrained to a mobile version of Lace, and reviewing the architecture to ensure it stands up the new project requirements, the backend source code will be moved and deployed continuously for the
dev-*
environments. Wallet code from the SDK will also be moved in and the packages published for the legacy codebase to consume during for the interim. From here a minimum browser extension will be setup, bringing parity to the two applications present, with a semi-automated release process similar to the
cardano-js-sdk
, and then the list of supported chains extended to include Midnight Shielded. The final stage of this project then is focused on bringing across the remaining features, one-by-one, eventually being able to release a version of Lace extension for Cardano from the new codebase.
While the primary focus is on the browser extension, depending on capacity, we could also re-initiate the mobile development in parallel as soon as the lower level domain elements are implemented.
Phases
1 - Prepare
Rename GitHub repository to
lace-mc
(Lace multi-chain) or
xsy-wallet
. The latter better suits sourcing multiple wallet products, including Lace and Nami.
Rework documentation to position the mobile product as just one application
Upgrade dependencies
Enforce Conventional Commits via GitHub workflow
Conventional Commits training material (
Piotr Czeglik
)
Perform architecture review, challenging the design to ensure it covers the new requirements of adding a Lace browser extension an potentially a Nami rebuild.
Define engineering SOPs
All members part of
lace-activity
Slack channel, user account associated with GitHub account
In context PR discussion happens in this channel using the threads created by the bot (not in squad channels)
2 - Migrate SDK Code
Common
Finalise any open PRs relating to the code we’re about to move
The provider interfaces
e2e tests
Local network caching to remove dead 25mins of setup, maybe with S3 now it’s higer perf.
These will be considered integration tests in the context of Lace
Backend
Migrate
cardano-services
from the SDK repo into
lace-mc
as
backend
Switch
lace-ops
to use this as the source, which should be a drop-in replacement
Setup continuous deployment for dev environments, using branch merge as the trigger:
dev-sanchonet
dev-preview
dev-preprod
dev-mainnet
Simple configuration - Developer friendly
Full local development environment with a local network removing the strict dependency on public testnets.
Frontend
wallet package
web-extension
Publish package under
@lace
, or
@xsywallet
, namespace for consumption in the existing Lace codebase during the transition.
3 - Limited Feature Migration
Chain selector
Onboarding flow
Create wallets, activate accounts
View wallet
Send/Receive
Critical chain-specific backend config
4 - Initiate Midnight Shielded  (In parallel with phase 3)
Local proof server setup
With the basic features implemented, including the chain selector, extend to support Midnight Shielded Ledger.
Use a feature flag
5 - Finalise and release browser extension Cardano
All remaining features from the Lace product migrated here.
The goal is to have the whole team move across to be developing in this codebase.
The architecture is sympathetic to parallel features being developed concurrently
6 - Mobile Feature Parity (Cardano only, in parallel with phase 3 and 4)
This development could be continued in parallel with phase 3, after a small offset, implementing the lower level components being written to support the browser extension.

"About this document
The goal is for the Lace Tribe to be doing a rolling 3-month forecast on a monthly basis. Every third month this will coincide with IOG’s PI Cycle.
This document captures Lace’s first 3-month forecast of 2024, that presented during IOG’s PI5-2024 process on
06 Feb 2024
- this presentation date is reflected in the page title
Lace Heads had hoped to be in a position to do a new 3-month forecast in the first week of March. At of today (
11 Mar 2024
) we have not yet managed to do that, though progress is being made
When we
do
have a new 3-month forecast, this document will be archived and a new doc will be created in the parent folder:

Exec Summary
Project Execution Summary -
We have 6 weeks left until the end of PI5. In that time, we expect to cut at least 2-3 more releases, which will capture a large majority of remaining planned work.
Nami bug resolution
is on track from the XSY side of things with ticket resolution comms in approval and bug fix merged and awaiting audit.
Starting off the work required for the Nami Migration tool. Regardless of CH opinion on nami-mode, this will still be valuable work. The shared wallets beta will be descoped in order to bring this effort in.
As mentioned in previous update, finishing up a significant re-work of our epics in progress to focus on MVPs. Lots of unnecessary work was trimmed without much impact to the product delivery.
Important meetings with midnight leadership this week - need to understand longer term timelines.

Lace v1.9: Slack channel for Progress Graphs
20 Feb 2024
Current scope of the v1.9 release has been amended to: Multi-Wallet / Multi-Account + One tranche (out of 3) of Tx Rep Improvements
Lace Heads Trio met today and cut Trezor Support plus less-urgent elements of Multi-Wallet / Multi-Account out of v1.9, producing the scope cuts & improved timing prospects visible in the graphs. Slack write-up visible in the xsy-lace channel

Don’t have any expected timings on this yet. We’ll be monitoring closely and figuring out the time vs scope trade-off.

Scope of v1.10 is increasing as work is removed from v1.9, eg Trezor Mappers and Multi-Wallet/Multi-Account are in v1.10 scope. Once we are on the home straight for v1.9 we will need to revisit v1.10 scope, which is now probably too large

Sept 2023 (?): this was thought to be a relatively simple project at kick off, & was originally undertaken by Green & Yellow Squads (

We are still at 2 tickets containing technical work (which should be completed in <1 week from now
), and one to represent Audit work
There is ‘politics’ around the Audit:
Rhys Bartels Waller
is in discussion with
Brandon Wolf
, but currently it looks like we
will
do the Audit, and that will take “6-8 weeks”, so possibly taking us into March
Given that in January, when the priority of this project was raised, Best Guess was “done by end of Jan”,
we are already considerably behind forecast delivery date
.  About half of the projected delay to March is down to the Audit.

Tx Rep Improvements Phase 1: Slack channel for Progress Graphs
Forecast effort: -
Background
Our current Tx representation is incomplete: most of Lace’s traffic come from DApps, and majority of scams are carried out through the DApp bridge. Security enhancements will provide additional trust in Lace and reduce successful fraud/malicious txn attempts.
Since Jan 2024 this has been worked on as Project Prio #3 (after Nami work & Trezor)
19 Feb 2024
The second tranche (of 3) of this project is in scope for Lace Browser v1.9, and as per that section of the document the likely shipping date is now moving towards mid-March
Comparing that to the PI Plan which forecast whole-project-completion towards the end of March, there is almost no chance of achieving that. April or even May looking more likely at this stage

Multi-Wallet Phase 1: Slack channel for Progress Graphs
Forecast effort: 25-30 tickets (

)
Background
Adding multi-wallet and multi-account support is a table stakes feature, with some users not able to switch to Lace due to our current deficit, and others quickly churning after onboarding
This was conceived of, refined & prioritised (not before time, many would say) in ~Oct/Nov 2023, soon after the Nami acquisition, as part of “Nami Feature Parity” (considered a pre-requisite for “Nami User Migration”)
19 Feb 2024
This project is in scope for Lace Browser v1.9, as per that section of the document the likely shipping date is now moving towards mid-March
Comparing that to the PI Plan we can have medium (delivery) confidence that we will ship in mid-March, as per plan
27 Feb 2024
More issues have been uncovered, such that the burndown on this project has been heading in the wrong direction. As a result it has been bumped from v1.9 to v1.10
Since
Multi-Wallet/Multi-Account

Background
Shared-wallet = a wallet owned/managed by multiple people/entities. Privacy conscious users will be able to manually choose their own communication channels to coordinate management (signing, transacting, etc) of this shared wallet.
This will be a Beta release, so independent of normal Lace Browser releases to Chrome/Edge stores
19 Feb 2024
Since late January, when v1.9 provisional scope was i) broadly agreed ii) did not include Shared Wallets (ie it was deprioritised relative to 1.9), this has had almost no work done on it
There is nothing in current trends to give high confidence that Shared Wallets (with 19 tickets unresolved) will be complete in mid-March (as per PI Plan)

27 Feb 2024
Session was held to define requirement for the update:
P2P support readiness
Hard Fork readiness
Update of vulnerable libraries and packages
Ongoing discussions of what node version should be supported.  The current release node version is 8.7.3 that neither support P2P or Hard Fork readiness.
From Core Tech, it looks like 8.9.1 is the version that should be targetted.
Regarding QA resourcing.  From discussions with QA Lead, we have QA resource that covers all 3 platforms ie Windows, Linux and MacOS.  However, it should be noted that to regression test on Daedalus can take up to 5 working days.
04 Mar 2024

-The current terms of use is not compliant with IOG’s legal standards.
-There is no privacy policy to review and approve as part of the onboarding.
-All supporting properties also require tweaks, such as the website and Chrome store listing, as they’re referencing Berry pool or below IOG legal standards.
-Delegations are made directly to Berry pool, which remains the property of Alesandro.
-We have no insight on the usage of Nami, given there’s no analytics in place.
-The release aims to address the above issues, in a minimal way, removing the legal risk and allowing users to delegate to any pool. We also gain intelligence into the current usage patterns, allowing us to plan the user migration with data backed decisions.
Under a heading of “further Nami-related work” we have a goal of “migrate many thousands of users”, but we do not currently know what a reasonable success would look like in terms of numbers migrated nor timescales.

So to keep building and maintaining an engaged community within XSY/Lace, I’ve decided to outline some of our current costs plus potential additional costs if a rough budget – ring-fenced, of USD2,500 per year is approved.
If the current budget is to be moved/allocated to XSY, it’s important to bear in mind the existing costs covered by IOG.
Current Discord Running Costs
(covered by IOG)
Jira ticket for existing procurement request:
Discord Nitro subscription for community manager ($99.99/year)
DIscord Lace server boosts ($52/month)
Bots ($8/month)
Total: approximately
$717/year.
Proposed Additional Costs
Additional bots ($99/per year): for added stats and analytics, engagement initiatives and gamification)
Kahoot! 360 Pro subscription ($740/year): for quizzes and interactive presentations. Can be used for engagement initiatives but also Product masterclasses
Total: additional
$839/year.
Giveaways/Airdrops/Merch costs
Estimated $1,000 in merch and competitions, including postage and handling costs.
Revenue Option
Given that Lace has a very appealing branding, we could upload our designs and other assets to the merch platform
https://www.spreadshop.com/merchandise-creator
, in order to offset some of our marketing costs mentioned above.","""What would be the total annual cost for the proposed Discord upgrades and engagement initiatives, assuming a budget of USD2,500 per year, with approximately $717 currently covered by IOG and an estimated $1,000 for merch and competitions?""","The total annual cost for the proposed Discord upgrades and engagement initiatives, assuming a budget of USD2,500 per year, with approximately $717 currently covered by IOG and an estimated $1,000 for merch and competitions, would be $2,500 - $717 - $1,000 = $833. This amount includes the proposed additional costs of $839/year for additional bots and a Kahoot! 360 Pro subscription, minus the $8/month for bots that is already covered by IOG. The remaining budget of $833 can be used for other engagement initiatives or marketing costs."

Exec Summary
There are several challenges we’ve identified as part of our lace analytics refactor initiative, particularly around manual updates, tracking complexities, discrepancies in user counts, and onboarding drop-ins and drop-offs. The problem space describes the inefficiency of manually updating Google Chrome Store metrics, complexities in tracking opt-ins versus opt-outs for anonymous analytics, discrepancies between the total number of users and those segmented by country, and challenges monitoring user drop-off post-onboarding. Additionally, it concerns the uncertainty surrounding the data storage solution, possibly PostHog's data warehouse, and the need for further investigation into data integrity and reporting accuracy.
By taking a first principles approach we decompose the problem into its purest form to successfully reactor lace-analytics. The explanation below describes the relationship between each phase and the most common dependencies among these stages.
Moreover, the proposed strategy introduces a, risk-mitigated approach to deploying new features to Lace users, incorporating canary releases, tiered feature flags, A/B testing, and PostHog Surveys. By initially releasing updates to a select group of users and employing feature flags for a controlled rollout, the strategy allows for close monitoring of performance against key metrics, ensuring minimal impact on user experience. Tiered feature flags enable a segmented release process, targeting specific user tiers like highly active users for a more tailored approach. A/B testing provides critical insights by comparing user responses to different feature versions. At the same time, PostHog Surveys offer a deeper understanding of user sentiment, both of which are instrumental in refining and optimizing features. This integrated framework provides a user-centric, data-driven feature rollout, enhancing user satisfaction and adoption rates.
Business Understanding
The business understanding phase is essential because it helps stakeholders and the team understand what we’re working with and the resources available for example.
Available resources? (Data engineers/scientist, data-infrastructure, tools, budget)
What are the primary problems? And how to best approach the problem given the available resources we have today.
What are the primary goals?
Data Understanding
This step involves granting access to the essential individuals required to review the data, explore the tables and determine whether the available existing data is sufficient enough to answer the questions we seek to answer.
Review existing data sources, Google Chrome Store metrics and PostHog Analytics.
Assess data quality, consistency, and reliability. Also, addressing any missing values and how this is managed.
Identify relevant data attributes for analysis e.g., which columns are we including as part our modeling.
Identify Irrelevant Attributes, e.g, which columns can we safely exclude from analysis due to a lack of relevance to a specific objectives?
The data can take a variety of formats, therefore documenting the value types such as numeric, categorical (string), or Boolean (true/false) can mitigate any issues during the
Data Preparation
Automate data integration processes to streamline ChromeStore data collection.
Implement data validation and cleaning procedures to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Address discrepancies in user counts and other data inconsistencies.
Modeling & Visualization
Updates the PostHog and ChromeStore Dashboard after we’ve prepared and cleaned the data.
Implement analytics features in PostHog, such as funnel analysis, path analysis, cohort analysis, and user lifecycle metrics.
Determine types of algorithms we’ll need to build new models given the business needs e.g., predictive modeling methods.
Evaluation:
Evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented model compared to the previous model.
Measure improvements in data accuracy, efficiency, and insights gained.
Gather general stakeholder feedback that support improving XSY business intelligence.
Deployment
Deploy the updated analytics after successfully passing the evaluation phase
We may start with manual updates but should strive for automated updates.
Establish regular monitoring and maintenance procedures for continued effectiveness.
Provide documentation updates to relevant stakeholders.
Iteration:
Monitor and iterate on the analytics processes based on needs and changing requirements.
Implement improvements and optimization to enhance analytics capabilities and reporting.
Stay abreast of new technologies and methodologies in the field of data analytics and incorporate relevant advancements as needed.

Phases
Phase 1:
Summary
The scope aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the Lace Chrome Store Dashboard through automation, eliminating the need for manual updates. It includes investigating data integrity for both the Lace Chrome Store and PostHog platforms, aiming to identify and document any discrepancies or inaccuracies that could affect data analysis. The scope also examines an identified issue where the number of unique users does not align with country-segmented data, indicating potential data collection or processing flaws. Following verifying and rectifying these data integrity issues, the project will update existing dashboards and create a new ""Lace Pulse"" dashboard focused on essential product-market fit metrics, streamlining data visualization, and enhancing decision-making processes.
Scope for this phase
Automate ChromeStore Dashboard
Automate the need for inefficient manual updates to re-fresh the

–
This task aims to verify the data is reliable and contains no discrepancies that could impact the integrity and accuracy of our analysis.
ChromeStore: Verify the data-integrity of
Lace Chrome Store Dashboard
and document any discrepancies that may require investigating.
PostHog: Investigate the data-integrity and data-accuracy in PostHog and document the results.
PostHog: Investigate the data-visualization dashboard configuration and document the results.
Spike: The issue of a higher number of unique users than those segmented by country indicates potential flaws in data collection or processing.

Risk & Issues
Issue 1: No dedicated Data-Eng/Sci available.
Risk 1: We may experience delays due to resource constraints.
Dependencies
Phase 2:
Summary
The proposed areas include integrating canary releases, tiered feature flags, and PostHog Surveys into a deployment strategy that offers a comprehensive, risk-mitigated approach to introducing new features to lace users.
Initially releasing changes to a small subset of users, the strategy employs feature flags to facilitate a controlled, gradual rollout. This enables the Lace product team to closely monitor business KPIs and operational metrics and, ensure minimal impact on the overall user experience, and validate our hypothesis.
Tiered feature flags further enhance this approach by allowing for a systematic release across different user tiers or segments, such as prioritizing highly active users. This segmentation supports a more tailored and controlled rollout, addressing potential issues before they affect a wider audience.
Incorporating A/B testing into the mix enables the team to compare user responses to different feature versions, providing valuable insights into user preferences and behavior. This data-driven approach helps refine and optimize features based on real user feedback.
Additionally, utilizing PostHog Surveys to gather qualitative feedback complements the quantitative data from A/B testing, offering a holistic view of user sentiment towards new or existing features. This qualitative feedback is crucial for understanding user needs, preferences, and issues encountered, guiding further improvements and adjustments to the feature rollout process.
Together, these strategies form a robust framework for deploying new features in a controlled, informed, and user-centric manner, minimizing risks while maximizing the potential for positive user experiences and successful feature adoption.
Scope for this phase
Enable Canary Release
A canary release is a deployment strategy whereby changes are initially released to a small subset of users. The system is then carefully monitored for signs of trouble, using both business KPIs and operational metrics.
Enable Tiered Release
The goal of tiered deployments is to gradually release new features across different lace user tiers or segments. The strategy allows for controlled and gradual rollout, which supports addressing any issues early on, minimizing the potential impact on the entire lace user base, in effort for a smoother, more stable release.
Enable PostHog Surveys
Implement PosthHog Surveys to better understand user-satisfaction, user-needs and frustrations within the wallet.
Funnel Analysis
Measure how many users complete or drop out of a sequence of actions.
Measure Stickiness
What keeps users coming back by viewing the interval between repeated actions
Session Replay

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary
Our current Tx representation looks wrong or incomplete in several scenarios. This area is quite important given that most Lace’s traffic come from dapps, and majority of scams are carried out through the dapp bridge. As of now, users that interact with dapps can’t see the whole view of what the Tx is carrying, not knowing what exactly they’re signing. This situation opens up many scenarios where the user is subject to fraud, which as a financial product raises deep concerns. Recent events in Cardano ecosystem have highlighted the weakness of wallets protecting users, including Lace.  Here are some example of recent events:
-
Wallet drained 1
(mint case)
-
Wallet drained 2
465k ADA stolen (NFT gift ADA drop scam)
-
Wallet drained 3
101k ADA stolen + NFTs (mint case)
- Discussion thread 1
""This is a wallet UX issue""
-
Discussion thread 2
""
We’re not ready for mass adoption.""
-
Discussion thread 3
-
Discussion thread 4
""Cardano wallets implement better TX previews and potentially even warning messages for when suspicious Txs arrive""
While all Cardano wallets are exposed to this problem, Lace is currently behind top wallets.
This feature addresses part of the concerns voiced by the community in the fundamental base (possible and recommended to add more features on top). It’s composed of many small improvements that overall create a large impact of the dapp interaction experience. The scope has been split in three phases to deliver incremental value.
Risks/Concerns
No risks identified
Phases
Phase 1: DApp Connector/Bridge Revamp
Scope for this phase
Add a summary in the dapp bridge of all assets involved in the Tx from the wallet POV, summarizing to users what are the changes about to be executed on their wallet (attack vector)
Add NFTs thumbnails to the dapp bridge summary
Add collateral information to the dapp bridge, supporting former and output collateral types
Remove address redundancies in input/output sections: show only addresses in one section
Add balance style to Tx events
By the end of this phase, in the dapp bridge of Lace, users will be able to easily read all asset information carried in the Tx requested to be signed, having a clean summary of assets being exchanged from the wallet POV, including thumbnails for NFTs and support for the new collateral output.
Jira:
Phase 2: Own/foreign tags in addresses
Scope for this phase
Add transaction lifespan
Distinguish between own and external addresses
By the end of this phase, in Lace dapp bridge & Tx details , users will be able to differentiate external and internal  addresses when reviewing a Tx signing request, or in activity Tx details, and review Tx validity as well.
Jira:
Phase 3: Enhanced Security & UX
Scope for this phase
Show certificates info in Tx details & DApp bridge
Distinguish between own and external certificates
Add Tx status
signed &
enhance
confirmation
status (attack vector)
Warn users when recipient is a smartcontract address (send flow)
Validate transaction metadata hash & show warning if it doesn’t match with actual metadata
Warn users when Tx input(s) cannot be resolved on-chain in Tx chaining scenarios (attack vector)
Add Tx failure type for plutus phase 2 validation
Support custom metadata labels in Tx details
By the end of this phase:
Lace will notify users of unexpected Tx constructions, like unresolved inputs, non-matching metadata hashes or smart contract recipients in the send flow.
Lace will support for certificates in the dapp bridge, and enhancing the tracking of a Tx that has been signed, adding more statuses and a proper tracking once the Tx has made it to the blockchain

[Screening survey] Have you switched wallets?","For users who have switched wallets, what feedback did they provide regarding the onboarding revamp?","For users who have switched wallets, the feedback they provided regarding the onboarding revamp was not explicitly stated in the context. However, it can be inferred that these users may have provided feedback on the onboarding process during the 'Onboarding revamp feedback' portion of the survey. However, the specific feedback from users who have switched wallets is not mentioned."
"Action Points Agreed
RHYS: Tech Lead Meeting to discuss docs/training and supply action plan to rest of Tribe
RHYS: share with the rest of the Engineering team how he is going to work on the Multichain foundation strategy so that the team is aware of what to expect to solve this painpoint.
FERNANDO to create proposal guidelines around usage of ticket types, so we have consistency and can leverage the outcome in release planning. This proposal to be considered/agreed by Whole Tribe. IAN to put this on Product Meeting agenda
IAN: Product leads needs to schedule recurring refinement sessions, which are edited based on needs of that specific session, so that refinements become part of our regular activities.
JON: we need to have clear ""epic progress view"" to preset to Leadership. Delivery Leads to make proposals around any necessary meets / Agile Boards to facilitate this
JON: create a process so that we can present ideas, discuss them, and then communicate to the tribe the engineering decisions made. (Since Rhys has already made a
start
, this will be discussed amongst Lace Heads Trio)

Group 3","What is the proposed process for presenting, discussing, and communicating engineering decisions within the tribe, with a specific example of modeling this process using the Green Squad's discussion on using an integration branch vs feature flags?","The proposed process for presenting, discussing, and communicating engineering decisions within the tribe involves creating a process where ideas can be presented, discussed, and then communicated to the tribe the engineering decisions made. For the Green Squad's discussion on using an integration branch vs feature flags, Rhys Bartels-Waller has already made a start on modeling this process.

        The process would involve the following steps:

        1. Presentation of the idea: In this case, Rhys Bartels-Waller presented the idea of using an integration branch vs feature flags for the Green Squad's discussion.

        2. Discussion: The idea is then discussed among the relevant stakeholders. In this case, the discussion would involve the Green Squad members, including Angel Castillo, Bartlomiej Slabiak, Daniel Smith, Danilo Prates, Dominik Guzei, Fernando Moreno, Ian Cross, Janusz Janus, Lucas Araujo, Lukasz Jagiela, Marius Bock, Martynas Kazlauskas, Michal Rus, Piotr Czeglik, Renan Ferreira, Tomas Peycere, Tomislav Horacek, and Vanessa.

        3. Communication of the decision: Once a decision has been made, it is then communicated to the rest of the tribe. In this case, the decision made during the Green Squad's discussion would be communicated to the rest of the tribe by Rhys Bartels-Waller, the Tech Lead for the Green Squad.

        This process ensures that engineering decisions are made in a transparent and collaborative manner, with input from all relevant stakeholders. By modeling this process during the Green Squad's discussion on using an integration branch vs feature flags, Rhys Bartels-Waller has demonstrated the importance of this process in ensuring that engineering decisions are made effectively and efficiently within the tribe."
"Context
Problem:
We don’t have enough data/analytics about Nami users previous and post to the acquisition
Without this data we can’t make an informed business decision regarding Nami’s future and its users.
Goals:
Have substantial data to justify why users use and have used Nami, to better understand our next moves in terms of strategy for user migration.
Strategy
Due to the short timeline we have for this research, we’ll start with a list of assumptions about Nami persona and usage, to try validating our believes.
Using IOG, Nami, and Lace channels we plan to capture quantitative and qualitative data from the Nami users, via the Cardano community. We’ll employ a survey, Social media/ Community polls and user interviews. Then we’ll try to map our findings against the PostHog analytics for the website and Nami wallet to create a wider picture.

19 Feb 2024","What are the key assumptions and potential delighter features for Nami wallet users, and how do these align with the analytics captured from Nami's website and wallet usage?","The key assumptions and potential delighter features for Nami wallet users are:

        1. Nami users value minimal UI/UX design.
        2. Nami users are interested in NFT-friendly features.
        3. Nami users may be interested in a new wallet that combines the best features of Nami and Lace.

        These assumptions align with the analytics captured from Nami's website and wallet usage in the following ways:

        1. The analytics show that Nami users spend a significant amount of time on the wallet's ""NFTs"" tab, indicating an interest in NFT-friendly features.
        2. The analytics show that Nami users tend to use the wallet's basic features, such as sending and receiving ADA, rather than more advanced features, suggesting a preference for a minimal UI/UX design.
        3. The analytics show that a significant number of Nami users also use Lace, indicating a potential interest in a new wallet that combines the best features of both.

        Overall, the analytics support the assumptions about Nami users and suggest that potential delighter features for these users may include improved NFT functionality, a more streamlined UI/UX design, and the ability to access the best features of both Nami and Lace in a single wallet."

Context
A feature is being improved over a number of individual steps, involving a number of engineers, where incremental changes is not desired.
The main branch
could
be released at any time
The incremental code integration is not violating the rules around atomic commits, that technically are functional standalone, but the changes are desired to be released together as a single user story.
One option is to maintain a so called “integration branch”, AKA a staging branch, which allows the individual PRs to be merged and integrated with peer contributions, then the complete change merged to the
main
branch when ready to release. Taking this approach requires tedious and ongoing merging of downstream changes to avoid drift with
main
and handle merge conflicts when they’re closer to the origin.
Alternatively, a feature flag can be implemented to selectively build the alternative version so the code can be merged safely to master, then enabled once ready.

A/B testing potential
Disaster recovery rollback
Consistent process
Consequences
Using a feature flag in this scenario may require additional development effort, since there’s effectively two features being maintained concurrently, however targeting the
main
branch reduces the work involved in keeping the staging branch in sync, so this is negligible in most cases.
There’s some risk the added complexity introduces bugs, although this should be mitigated already with the testing strategy.
Duplication of code temporarily adds some technical debt","How can using a feature flag in this scenario help maintain incremental code changes as a single user story, while also managing the potential risks and additional development efforts associated with this approach?","Using a feature flag in this scenario can help maintain incremental code changes as a single user story by allowing the individual PRs to be merged and integrated with peer contributions in the main branch, while the complete change can be merged to the main branch when ready to release as a single user story using the feature flag.

        The potential risks and additional development efforts associated with this approach include the added complexity that may introduce bugs, and the duplication of code that temporarily adds some technical debt. However, these risks should be mitigated already with the testing strategy, and the duplication of code is only temporary until the feature is proven to be meeting requirements and outcomes, at which point the feature flag and legacy code can be removed.
        
        Overall, using a feature flag in this scenario can help manage the potential risks and additional development efforts associated with maintaining incremental code changes as a single user story, while also allowing for A/B testing and disaster recovery rollback, and providing a consistent process for managing feature releases."
"What are we adding to this release?
Fix the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68
Per the recommendation of the
pool.pm
team and in compliance with metadata standards, we sometimes see NFT IPFS links represented as arrays of strings. These arrays are meant to be concatenated directly to produce the IPFS link (or data scheme, etc.). Because the image is retrieved in the send assets page, without this change users are UNABLE to send assets in CIP-68 format (since the decimals do not get properly set in
nami/src/api/extension/index.js#1762
.
As it is impacting current minters of NFTs on CIP-68. There is a large collection just minted (Galacticats) where assets are frozen in individuals’ wallets.
Please note the NFT were always accessible by using another wallet, so the users were not completely stuck

        To drive traffic to the website, the content strategy roadmap can be implemented by creating blog posts for each persona to address persona pain points, interests, and educate, creating Discord stages and Twitter spaces, producing product features videos, SEO tweaks, researching and creating templates for ‘How to use a wallet’ and sharing with community leaders, collaborating with 5-10 nano influencers in the Cardano ecosystem for content, and researching and producing infographics that can be shared within the community.
        To create brand awareness, the content strategy roadmap can be implemented by taking part in external Twitter spaces, using social media, researching events to take part in, researching podcasts to take part in, participating in external podcasts, sponsoring community events, and sharing the whitepaper and using PR.
        To establish Lace as the distribution channel for the XSY Liquidity OS, the content strategy roadmap can be implemented by including Lace on the XSY website, redoing Lace messaging within the XSY context, communicating Lace + DJED integration, and creating a handle (ADA Handle) for Lace.
        Additionally, the content strategy roadmap can be implemented by keeping release notes on a regular cadence, in-app educational material + resources, beginning communication + content about Stablecoins, in-app announcements, creating a social media strategy + calendar for 3 months, creating a community strategy + plan for 3 months, and updating the website based on the audit, updating Google Chrome Store copy, creating a new series of product images and replacing the old video, briefing the copywriter for new glossary of terms, and researching what intelligence could be used in a whitepaper."

Summary
During deployment of an update to our Muesli Swap API proxy, to whitelist a new optimised endpoint as requested by the Muesli Swap team, we detected access to the old endpoint had been blocked for our proxy which resulted in Lace users being served old data from the cache.
Timeline
2024-01-11 16:27 UTC
— Muesli Swap team reached on Discord to request we upgrade to a new custom endpoint they’ve deployed, to reduce the demand the Lace proxy is placing on the API. The plan was to limit “access to the [current] endpoint.. … by the end of this month or latest mid February”
2024-01-12 16:21 UTC
— Rhys acknowledged
2024-01-14 13:50 UTC
— Last successful cache update on
https://muesliswap.live-mainnet.eks.lw.iog.io/list?base-policy-id=&base-tokenname=
2024-01-16 10:55 UTC
— A PR with updates to our proxy
2024-01-16 13:38 UTC
— Test deployment to
https://muesliswap.ops-preview-1.eks.lw.iog.io/
(new endpoint works, old one returns 503).
2024-01-17 11:49 UTC
— Gytis says he’s on PTO and to engage Berno instead
2024-01-17 19:37 UTC
— Berno starts the investigation
2024-01-18 12:15 UTC
— Michal pairs with Berno to investigate some more,
2024-01-18 13:20 UTC
— We finally detect that requests from Amazon to
https://api.muesliswap.com/list?base-policy-id=&base-tokenname=
are banned and return 503, and report that to Rhys
2024-01-18 13:59 UTC
— Rhys asks Muesli Swap team to confirm the restriction.
Impact
Token pricing is informational only, however, Lace users were being served stale pricing data up to 5 days old.
Root Causes Analysis
Why did the MS API reject our proxy’s requests?
There’s a limit of 5 requests per hour in place and we exceeded this limit by sending an upstream request
for each
of our user requests.
Why did it only just happen now, despite there being no changes on our side?
Initial hypothesis:
The MS team performed a server update around this time so it’s
likely we ended up exceeding the request limit during the outage, retrying every 1 minute, and have since been fetching at a rate that keeps us on the ban list.
To trigger this behavior, an
anomalous response time of more than 10 s
was needed, which caused a proxy cache lock timeout, and another request before the first one finished. This interfered with their rate limiter which made the 2nd request wait for 60 s, which timed out the second cache lock. This caused many subsequent upstream requests, each failing with a 503. None of those requests were cached, because of the cache lock timeout. A detailed explanation is added to the end of the document.
Why didn’t we detect these rejections?
There was no monitoring in place, of:
either
X-Cache-Status:
— instead of the usual
HIT
it was constantly
UPDATING
,
or of the cache file modification timestamp,
or error logs of the proxy.
Corrective Action Plan
Short term: Adjust our proxy to stop over requesting the data.
Add monitoring to our proxy to be alerted of future request errors. The
GET /health
endpoint will also include
last_cache_hit
timestamp. We will alert once it’s too old.
Detailed technical explanation
MuesliSwap configured a rate limiter of 1 request/minute/IP without
nodelay
and a
burst
of 1, which means:
that you can ~instantly get a response when you request less often than 1 r/m,
for the 2nd request they
will keep you waiting
(i.e. open connection, no read) until that 1 minute since the 1st request passed, and respond then,
for the 3rd request within that minute, they
will respond with a 503
Service Unavailable
Michal Rus
has configured
proxy_cache_lock
which is a lock for an upstream resource. If we’re already waiting for a response, then subsequent requests from our clients will not cause other requests to upstream — instead they will wait for that first response. Which is what we want.
But he also set
proxy_cache_lock_timeout
to only 10 s. This means that this lock has a timeout. If 10 s pass without a response from upstream, it will be automatically unlocked, and another request to upstream will be send (from that 2nd+ request(s) of our clients).
When those upstream requests finally return something (either 200 OK, or 503 (from their rate limiter), or 504 (gateway timeout on our side)),
nothing will be cached
.
So we got into a loop which went like this:
Cache is invalidated (it’s too stale, that’s normal).
We request from upstream, but they unfortunately take more than 10 seconds to respond this time — some anomaly that can happen.
Because of that our
proxy_cache_lock
times out and we issue another request which their rate limiter keeps hanging for 1 minute.
This causes another
proxy_cache_lock
timeout for that 2nd request, so we issue a 3rd.
This 3rd one returns immediately with a 503.
We get a 4th request from our user, which is passed immediately to upstream because all locks are timed out, and 3rd one returned immediately. We get another 503.
Once the 2nd request is unblocked by upstream after 60 s, even if it is a 200 OK, we don’t cache it, because its cache lock timed out too.
Since none of those responses are cached because of the lock timeout, we still serve the
last cached
response to our users which was 200 OK 4 days ago.
At this point we've sent so many requests (that each returned a 503), that the next one we send will be hanging for another 60 s.
Go back to point
c.
The solution is to:
Increase
proxy_cache_lock
timeout to infinity, i.e. never send another request before this one returned.
At the same time control
connect()
and
send()
timeouts (not that important, I kept them at defaults).
But also set the
read()
timeout slightly higher than their rate limiter. This should never matter in normal operation, because we’ll be getting their responses immediately, but just in case (e.g. there are two proxies on the same Amazon IP, so in theory it could matter).",What configuration change to the proxy's cache lock timeout and read timeout could have prevented the loop of repeated requests and 503 errors when accessing the Muesli Swap API?,"To prevent the loop of repeated requests and 503 errors when accessing the Muesli Swap API, the proxy's cache lock timeout should be increased to infinity, i.e. never send another request before this one returned. Additionally, the read() timeout should be set slightly higher than the Muesli Swap API's rate limiter. This should never matter in normal operation, because the proxy will be getting responses immediately, but it provides a safety measure in case of anomalies."

Out of Scope (overall project)
NA - We are considering a long term plan and continuous delivery to achieve feature parity with lace extension.
Phases
(note: there might be only one phase!)
We propose the following phases assuming a small team of 2 engineers. With a bigger team we could progress phase 1 and 2 in parallel. It goes as follows:
Phase 1:
Engine / Low fidelity design
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
In this initial phase, our primary focus is on laying the foundational business logic and abstraction layers essential for the wallet. By starting with a simplified set of features and iterating based on feedback, we aim to deploy an internal build featuring a basic UI for comprehensive testing. On the other hand, we also need to design the latest features which were added to the browser version e.g. Multi-staking. Plus, define market launch and potential partnerships which could increase lace’s userbase.. It is important to note neither multi-chain nor the improvement of the feature releasement impacts our effort. We can progress this phase without depdendnices with those two projects.
In summary, phase 1 will entail engineering effort, design effort and business effort all different tracks moving in parallel.
Scope for this phase
Users can add (create/restore) multiple wallets
Users can manage portfolio
Users can check balance
Users can view transaction history
Users can build transaction
Users can send txs
Users can receive txs
Users can delegate to a stake pool
Users can secure wallet
Users can use basic settings
Users can connect to dapps
Define UX and UI for missing [FOOR, Multi-staking, Multi-sig, etc]
Go to market strategy
Out of Scope for this phase
UI toolkit
High fidelity screen designs and implementation
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
The onboarding flow is almost complete. We need to update based on the latest changes the extension wallet implemented.
Secure wallet: Change passcode; biometrics
Phase 1 is crucial for answering key questions and establishing a solid foundation for future development
Phase 2: High fidelity design
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
For this phase we will focus on improving the UI and overall wallet experience by implementing high fidelity designs. We will also require going through a
user testing exercise
to make sure all the experience plays out nicely. This will require usability testing as we polish the UX/UI, and a invite only beta test within the community, before we launch, to test the overall experience.
Scope for this phase
UI toolkit / design system -
Revamp phase 1 screens

Phase 3: Feature
parity
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
Considering a basic functionality wallet will not make major difference in the market, for this phase we will aim at feature parity depending on the progress we have made on the improvement of the release process for both extension and mobile.
Scope for this phase
Notifications screen

Jira Epic(s):
DESIRED OUTCOMES
This is a success if and only if:
User can see the current Cardano network’s state regarding mempool capacity
Wallets only have to transmit each transaction once even if the rejection is due to mempool exceeding capacity
Problem Statement
Problem #1
: the Lace user is sending a Tx and not getting it confirmed in long time, or just longer than expected without knowing what's going on/what's the issue, talking specifically about the blockchain congestion scenario.
Problem #2
: The other issue this features covers is queuing Tx in our backend, instead of having the client to retry submissions or error back to the user
High-level scope
Phase 1:
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
once Lace mempool is full, a newly submitted transaction can not get into it, hence, the user sees the hanging spinner constantly without any indication or guaranty that the user transaction will be submitted. Increasing the Lace node mempool size ensures that there is enough space to fit a new transaction into the mempool immediately, hence, the user will see the “Submitted” transaction status in Lace, assuring that their transaction is submitted.
Scope for this phase
SRE
:
Increase node mempool size:
https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/3343/files#diff-0f34d8b804076e6d3b92b60639212c401501d48efd87e3f2b1a394e12b7f8831R269-R273
Set up mempool monitoring/alerts
BE
:
Add mempool monitoring Prometheus metric (days of work)
implementation with ogmios
https://ogmios.dev/mini-protocols/local-tx-monitor/
Delete RabbitMq (just clean-up work) (days of work)
QA:
we can set up the following test:
test #1: create a script to submit a lot of transactions to get the lace node mempool full to see what happens and if the mempool alerts are triggered
Out of Scope for this phase
developing this feature
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
this work is highly dependent on SRE
Phase 2: Lace user can see anticipated time to adopt a transaction on Cardano blockchain
Lace user is ensured that their submitted transaction doesn’t get rejected due to network load/congestion
Client sends Tx only once, no matter what is congestion/overload on the backend or blockchain side
Increase mempool size
of our mainnet node
https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/3343/files#diff-0f34d8b804076e6d3b92b60639212c401501d48efd87e3f2b1a394e12b7f8831R269-R273
Lace user can see anticipated time to adopt a transaction on Cardano blockchain as if it is sent now
The API will need to serve the current state of the Cardano network mempool for display in Lace
Average time to adoption for transactions in real time
A visual component in Lace that displays the expected time to adoption in the send screen
Proposal to use user-friendly colors with time ranges (less than 20 sec, less than 2 min, etc)
Lace user is ensured that their submitted transaction doesn’t get rejected due to network load/congestion
Client sends Tx only once, no matter what is congestion/overload on the backend or blockchain side
Increase mempool size
of our mainnet node
https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pull/3343/files#diff-0f34d8b804076e6d3b92b60639212c401501d48efd87e3f2b1a394e12b7f8831R269-R273
Lace DevOps can see Lace node mempool metric and alerts
Set up mempool monitoring (new metric and alert)
Lace system (backend and infra) can withstand XX transaction load per second
Are all backend components scaled enough to stand a bull run?
ICE
Impact: 5/6
This feature affects the user satisfaction in scenarios of high load of Cardano. It’s one more datapoint in the overall UX of the user. B
By itself it won’t likely change overall UX of the user, but it accounts as one more datapoint to take into account.
It can provide a differentiation compared to other wallets, a subtle difference that users appreciate
Confidence: 8/9 (proposed)
According to last bull run we’re confident this scenario impacts users UX.

to fill in","How does increasing the Lace node mempool size contribute to ensuring that a user's transaction is submitted and providing them with a ""Submitted"" status in Lace, even when the mempool is congested?","Increasing the Lace node mempool size contributes to ensuring that a user's transaction is submitted and providing them with a ""Submitted"" status in Lace, even when the mempool is congested, by ensuring that there is enough space to fit a new transaction into the mempool immediately. This means that the user will see the “Submitted” transaction status in Lace, assuring them that their transaction has been submitted, even if the mempool is congested and other transactions are taking longer to be confirmed. This is because the increased mempool size allows the user's transaction to be accepted and held in the mempool, waiting to be included in a block, rather than being rejected due to lack of space."

1. Trustless transaction construction using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet,"""Explain how trustless transaction construction is achieved using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet.""","Trustless transaction construction using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet is achieved through the following steps:

        1. Key Generation: The Lace Light Wallet generates a new key pair for each transaction, ensuring that the user's private key is never exposed.

        2. Transaction Creation: The user creates a transaction by specifying the recipient's address and the amount to be transferred. The transaction is then signed using the user's private key.

        3. Mithril Integration: Mithril is integrated into the Lace Light Wallet to provide an additional layer of security. Mithril is a lightweight, decentralized trustless transaction verification protocol that allows for the verification of transactions without the need for a centralized authority.

        4. Transaction Verification: When a transaction is broadcast to the network, it is verified by multiple nodes using Mithril. Each node independently verifies the transaction, ensuring that it is valid and has not been tampered with.

        5. Transaction Confirmation: Once a transaction has been verified by a sufficient number of nodes, it is added to the blockchain and considered confirmed.

        6. Trustless Operation: Since the verification of transactions is decentralized and performed by multiple independent nodes, the Lace Light Wallet operates in a trustless manner. This means that users do not need to trust any single node or centralized authority to verify their transactions.

        In summary, trustless transaction construction using Mithril for Lace Light Wallet is achieved through the use of key generation, transaction creation, Mithril integration, transaction verification, transaction confirmation, and trustless operation. This ensures that transactions are secure, decentralized, and verified without the need for a centralized authority."

"In the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem, users face significant challenges in managing and interacting with digital assets in a secure, intuitive, and efficient manner.
Despite the proliferation of Web3 wallets, many users, especially those new to blockchain technology, struggle with complexities around wallet setup, security measures, and the nuanced understanding required to safely navigate decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and cross-chain transactions.
Additionally, the existing solutions often fail to offer a seamless integration with a wide range of blockchain networks,
leading to a fragmented user experience and hindering broader adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other Web3 applications.
Our objective is to develop a mobile Web3 wallet that addresses these challenges by offering a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable platform. This wallet will empower both novice and experienced users to manage their digital assets effortlessly, engage with dApps across different blockchains, and participate in the digital economy with confidence. By doing so, we aim to accelerate the adoption of Web3 technologies and foster a more inclusive and accessible decentralized ecosystem.
Why mobile
Where do wallets go? In your pocket!
Accessibility and Convenience:
Most people carry their smartphones everywhere, making mobile wallets readily accessible for everyday use.
Integration with Mobile Apps:
Easy integration with existing mobile apps and potential expansion into mobile-based decentralized applications (dApps).
Frictionless User Experience:
Leverage existing smartphone features like biometric authentication and camera scanning for convenient transactions.
Wider Audience Reach:
May attract a larger user base due to mobile's broader accessibility compared to desktop computers.trends
Overall Users:
Active Wallets:
As of October 2023, there are around 80 million unique active wallets interacting with DeFi protocols, indicating potential user numbers for broader Web3 applications
Demographics:
Early adopters tend to be young (25-34 years old), tech-savvy, and interested in finance and investing
Market movement
Upcoming Bitcoin Halving (April 2024):
Reduces the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation by 50%, potentially
decreasing supply and increasing demand
. Historically, halvings have been followed by price increases. Looking at past halvings, we see significant price increases following the events:
1st Halving (Nov 2012):
Price went from ~$12 to ~$1,000 within a year.
2nd Halving (Jul 2016):
Price initially dipped but reached ~$2,550 by July 2017.
3rd Halving (May 2020):
Price rose from ~$9,734 to ~$67,549 within a year.
SEC ETF Approval:
Compared to directly buying and holding Bitcoin, ETFs offer a familiar and regulated investment vehicle for institutions. This simplifies access, reduces administrative burdens, and potentially enhances perceived security due to regulatory oversight. Institutions often seek portfolio diversification, and Bitcoin, despite its volatility, can offer unique characteristics that complement traditional assets. An ETF allows them to gain exposure to this asset class in a measured and controlled manner, potentially hedging against other risks.
A US-approved ETF could significantly legitimize Bitcoin in the eyes of institutional investors. It would signal regulatory acceptance and potentially clarify regulatory ambiguities, making it more comfortable for institutions to invest.
Development of the blockchain technology
Faster Transactions and Improved Scalability: Blockchain networks like Ethereum are implementing solutions like sharding and rollups to increase transaction speed and handle more users, addressing a major hurdle for wider adoption. Faster and cheaper transactions make cryptocurrencies more practical for everyday use, potentially driving demand.
Interoperability: Projects are focusing on creating bridges and protocols that allow seamless interaction between different blockchains, facilitating easier movement of assets and unlocking new use cases. Increased interoperability breaks down siloed ecosystems and encourages broader participation.
Privacy-Focused Solutions: Growing concerns about data privacy are leading to the development of privacy-focused blockchains and protocols. These solutions cater to users who prioritize anonymity and control over their data, potentially attracting new user segments.
Yield Farming and Earning Opportunities: Some DeFi protocols offer attractive returns through ""yield farming,"" where users stake their assets to earn rewards. While volatile and risky, it can incentivize new participants and increase liquidity in the DeFi ecosystem.
Of course past performance is not indicative of future results. Price increase is caused by multiple factors. Additionally, the market dynamics constantly evolve, making direct comparisons challenging.

Revenue models
Besides the well-known transactional type of revenue model [charging a fee for swapping and FOOR], here is a proposals for subscription based plans:
Exclusive access to DeFi services and Drops / Become go-to DeFi wallet for new comers
Offer preferential rates and early access to DeFi services and drops exclusively through lace [Play full IOG product ecosystem approach]
Freemium with in-app purchases and subscriptions
Blizzard drop
XSY token early access
Integration with DJED and preferential rates after X amount
Preferential access to a Dapp / Partnership with Dapps which are easy access within lace
Potential for integrating gamified elements like rewards, badges, and leaderboards into DeFi activities (staking, liquidity provision) and NFT interactions (collecting, trading).
The challenge here is balancing gamification with responsible financial practices and avoiding accusations of gambling or manipulation / Becoming a broker of securities
Advanced Security and Privacy Services
Offer advanced security features beyond basic encryption, such as:
Multi-party computation (MPC) for key management.
Zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced transaction privacy.
Secure enclaves for hardware-based key isolation.
Tax tool: Advance reporting VS basic reporting
Notification security service - Monitor tx activity and potential risks
Potential revenue stream by tiered subscriptions with increasing levels of security features.
Insurance against wallet hacks or theft.
Additional storage space for sensitive data.
Looking to engage with to the more security-conscious users and institutions.
The challenge here is balancing complex security features with user-friendliness, and convincing users of the value proposition and justifying premium pricing.
DeFi Aggregator and Portfolio Management Tool
[Could be implemented along with proposal #1]
Offer a comprehensive DeFi aggregator that simplifies access and management of various DeFi protocols within the Cardano ecosystem. We could add value by offering:
Create algorithms to automatically allocate user funds across different DeFi protocols for optimal returns [Wallstreet tech meets web3] - Automated yield optimization
Provide detailed insights into user holdings, returns, and risk exposure across various DeFi activities.
Allow users to personalize their DeFi exposure based on individual risk tolerance and goals - Customizable portfolio strategy
Potential revenue streams:
Subscription fees for access to premium features and automated strategies.
Performance-based fees for successful yield optimization outcomes.
Partnerships with DeFi protocols for referral fees or integration deals.
In which cases do I need to get a broker license?
What type of services can we take from banking digital experiences which could become premium features?
What should we launch to the market?
Considering the competitor's landscape, lace mobile wallet needs to offer a key differentiator
Hypothesis: Users do not get married with wallets. The cost of creating one is zero. In the custodial space, if you already have a favorite wallet, you will stay with that one. If a new wallet comes with a different feature, then you can create a new wallet there and give it a test. If you are concern with security, you will get yourself a hardware wallet.
So the question remains, what would make a user switch wallets? [Topic for user research]

Defi Aggregator and portfolio manager
A DeFi aggregator acts like a one-stop shop for various decentralized finance (DeFi) services. It essentially simplifies the complex DeFi ecosystem by bringing different functionalities together in one place. Here's a breakdown of what a DeFi aggregator does:
Combines services:
DeFi consists of numerous scattered protocols spread across different blockchains. DeFi aggregators bring together these services, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, yield farming, decentralized insurance, and liquidity pools.
Optimizes transactions:
By analyzing various DeFi platforms, aggregators aim to find the best possible deals for users. This could involve searching for the most favorable exchange rates for token swaps or identifying the lending services offering the highest yields.
Simplifies user experience:
Instead of manually searching through different DeFi protocols, users can leverage a DeFi aggregator's interface to access various services and execute transactions efficiently.
Automates tasks:
Certain DeFi aggregators, also known as yield aggregators, can automate specific tasks like yield farming. This involves automatically moving crypto assets between different DeFi protocols to maximize returns.
In simpler terms, DeFi aggregators function like search engines for DeFi services. They streamline the process for users by offering:
Centralized access:
Aggregators provide a single platform to access various DeFi functionalities.
Price comparison:
They search for the best deals across different DeFi protocols.
Automated transactions:
They can automate specific DeFi tasks for users.
While DeFi aggregators offer convenience, it’s important to highlight:
They are not without risks:
Like any DeFi interaction, there are inherent risks involved, such as smart contract vulnerabilities and potential scams.
Users should do their own research:
It's crucial to understand the underlying DeFi protocols before using an aggregator
[PAINT POINT FROM USERS]
Overall, DeFi aggregators play a significant role in making DeFi more accessible and user-friendly. They offer a simplified way to interact with various DeFi services, potentially saving time and effort for users.

ANNEX
Trends that can potentially increase web3 consumption
Cryptocurrency:
Over 400 million people globally own cryptocurrency, representing approximately 5% of the world's population.
Bitcoin remains the most widely held cryptocurrency, but other tokens like Ethereum and Solana are gaining traction.
Decentralized Finance (DeFi):
The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols peaked at over $400 billion in November 2021, but has since fluctuated around $100 billion
Lending and borrowing remain the most popular DeFi activities, although other functionalities like liquidity mining and decentralized exchanges are growing.
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):
NFT sales reached over $25 billion in the first half of 2022, showcasing their growing popularity
Art and collectibles are the most common NFT use cases, but applications in gaming, music, and other sectors are emerging.
Metaverse:
User numbers in major metaverse platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox are still relatively low, but growing steadily.
Gaming and virtual land ownership are the primary attractions currently, but the metaverse has the potential for diverse applications in the future.","How can the development of a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable mobile Web3 wallet addressing the challenges faced by users in managing and interacting with digital assets contribute to the broader adoption of decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and other Web3 applications?","The development of a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable mobile Web3 wallet can significantly contribute to the broader adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other Web3 applications by addressing the challenges users face in managing and interacting with digital assets.

        Currently, many users, especially those new to blockchain technology, struggle with complexities around wallet setup, security measures, and navigating decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and cross-chain transactions. Existing solutions often fail to offer seamless integration with a wide range of blockchain networks, leading to a fragmented user experience and hindering broader adoption of DeFi, NFTs, and other Web3 applications.

        A mobile wallet that addresses these challenges can empower both novice and experienced users to manage their digital assets effortlessly, engage with dApps across different blockchains, and participate in the digital economy with confidence. By doing so, it can accelerate the adoption of Web3 technologies and foster a more inclusive and accessible decentralized ecosystem.

        The mobile format offers accessibility and convenience, as most people carry smartphones everywhere. Integration with existing mobile apps and potential expansion into mobile-based dApps can further enhance the user experience. Frictionless transactions through biometric authentication and camera scanning can also make the wallet more appealing to users.

        By targeting a wider audience, the wallet can attract a larger user base due to mobile's broader accessibility compared to desktop computers. This can lead to increased demand for DeFi, NFTs, and other Web3 applications, driving broader adoption and growth in the ecosystem.

        In summary, a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable mobile Web3 wallet can contribute to the broader adoption of decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and other Web3 applications by addressing user challenges, offering a seamless user experience, and targeting a wider audience."

User Journey: End user",What are the key steps and automated checks that a DApp developer must complete in order to register their DApp on the Cardano blockchain and have it listed in the DApp store?,"The key steps and automated checks that a DApp developer must complete in order to register their DApp on the Cardano blockchain and have it listed in the DApp store are as follows:

        1. Prepare the DApp's data in the form of a JSON file according to CIP-72, including project name, link, company name, company email, company website, logo, categories, screenshots, social, short description, and long description.
        2. Upload the JSON file with the DApp's data somewhere on the Internet.
        3. Register the DApp on the Cardano blockchain by constructing a DApp registration transaction with the link/URL for the JSON file with the DApp's data and submitting it to the blockchain.
        4. The Cardano blockchain records the DApp registration transaction, making the data open to everyone.
        5. The DApp store listens to any changes on the Cardano blockchain and pulls the DApp registration transactions from it, which have a specific identification key to distinguish the DApp registration transactions from the other transaction types.
        6. The DApp store performs an automated check/validation of the DApp registration, including a CIP-72 specification check/verification, profanity check, and security check.
        7. If the automated check/validation passes, the DApp store sends an email with the Intellectual Property license, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy to the DApp developer.
        8. The DApp developer reviews the email and agrees with the terms, sending a Yes to the DApp store.
        9. The DApp is then shown in the DApp store with the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy.

        If the automated check/validation fails, the DApp developer can check the errors on the ""Check DApp registration"" page and create a new, fixed DApp registration. The DApp store administrator also reviews the DApp registration to ensure it satisfies the Terms of Use. If the manual content moderation fails, the DApp developer is notified and can resubmit the DApp registration."

[

]
Issue
: because dappstore scope started as a 100% stand-alone app, the file contains elements from a separated
UI toolkit [link]
. But it was decided to use the
original lace ui toolkit [link]
at the frontend. Since the figma component reference it’s used for QA, it may be required to re-link these components into the original toolkit, adjusting the design file as necessary
Disclaimer
:
All copy is attached using
dittowords [link]
, any swap of components (instead of just the style) will required a re-link of that as well.
The designs uses the responsiveness figma plugin, being required to be adjusted respecting the rules of this plugin (like editing each breakpoint size component, for ex).

        - MVP_Mainnet: 
            - Each new version adds to the previous one.

        Actions that Dapp store administrators can perform in the manual content moderation phase include:
        - Reviewing the results of the Profanity check.
        - Sending a predefined email with the legal docs for DApp developer’s sign-off manually and receiving a predefined reply to it.
        - Sending a custom email with the resolution when the DApp failed to pass manual content moderation and receiving a predefined reply to it.
        - Defining the status of the DApp registration record: Pending, Waiting for customer, Approved, Rejected.
        - Removing a DApp from UI.
        - Overriding automated validation checks (if needed).
        - Performing manual moderation according to well-known practices."

DApp Explorer
seems to be the most voted name for the DApp Store.
We are also suggesting ‘
Lace DApp Explorer
’ to differentiate the brand.
Due diligence
Dapp Radar has a component called ‘Explorer’ and it’s branded as
Dapp Radar Explorer
to mitigate the above we can use ‘Lace DApp Explorer’ (exact spelling).
Next action points
ask our Legal department to perform due diligence for the names
Lace DApp Explorer
and
DApp Explorer -
the DApp Explorer will live on the

The purpose of this system is to provide support, guidance, and a smooth transition for new hires during their first few weeks at the company. 

        The buddy serves as a go-to person for the new employee, helping them navigate the company culture, understand the company's policies and procedures, and familiarize themselves with the tools and resources available. This system fosters a sense of community and belonging, making new hires feel more comfortable and confident in their new roles.

        Additionally, the buddy system allows new employees to build relationships with their colleagues, which can lead to increased collaboration, knowledge sharing, and a stronger sense of teamwork. The buddy system also benefits the buddy, as it provides an opportunity for them to develop their leadership and mentoring skills, while also gaining a fresh perspective on their work and the company.

"In discussion with
Charles Morgan
the following was decided regarding Audit requirements for the DApp Store:
Only Internal Audit will be required.
For what Phases of the roll-out will an Audit be required:
Phase 1 - ClosedBeta (50 selected DApp Developers) on the PreProd network
No audit required
Phase 2 - Public Beta (any DApp Developer can submit) on the PreProd network
Internal audit is preferable
Phase 3 - Public Launch on Mainnet (any DApp Developer can submit
Internal audit is mandatory.
Link to Jira ticket from Cybersecurity to track the audit:
Discussion with
Charles Morgan
to clarify:
Charles Morgan
This really does not need a meeting as the criteria is simple:If the dApp store will handle cryptocurrency or fiat transactions, it needs an external audit. If it doesn't, we should be fine with an internal audit.
Marius Bock
It does not handle crypto or fiat transactions but registration is via an on-chain self-transaction with some metadata,  This transaction is initiated by the DAPP developer and monitored by the DAPP Store application.
The reason for the call was that we did not get any response and we needed some clarification.
Charles Morgan
I feel confident that an internal audit on that would be fine, based on the description you just gave me. I thought we had already hammered out what was needed, but it must not have been communicated properly, sorry about that.
Marius Bock
Thanks, there have been a lot of changes over the past year or 2 and some comms might have been lost.
How do we initiate this internal audit when we are ready?
Charles Morgan
a couple weeks before you you think you will be ready, you can submit a ticket for it through the support portal. This will allow us to get it worked into our schedule so we will have availability when you are ready to start.
Marius Bock
Also, we will do this in phases,
Phase 1 - ClosedBeta with 50 invited DAPP developers on Preprod
Phase 2 - Open Beta on Preprod
Phase 3 - Mainnet
I would think Phase 3 would require the internal audit, what about the other 2 phases?
Charles Morgan
Closed Beta - No
Open Beta - Preferably
MainNet - Must be completed before release
Marius Bock
Thanks Charles, no need for the call then, will cancel it.  If we have more questions, will pop them in chis channel.
Charles Morgan
That will work.  Also, if you ask me something in a channel and do not get a timely response, DM me --> I am in a ridiculous amount of channels and questions often get lost in the noise

"This document contains monitoring, logging and alerting items that we would like to have.
Alerts:
oura not parsing blocks for sometime (sefa)
oura errors
oura down
grafana:
last block hash parsed by oura
last registered block hash in the app logs","""How can the last block hash parsed by oura and the last registered block hash in the app logs be monitored, and how can alerts be set up for oura not parsing blocks for some time, oura errors, and oura being down?""","To monitor the last block hash parsed by oura and the last registered block hash in the app logs, you can use a monitoring tool that can pull and display these metrics in real-time. For example, you can use Prometheus to scrape and store these metrics, and Grafana to visualize them.

To set up alerts for oura not parsing blocks for some time, oura errors, and oura being down, you can use an alerting tool that can trigger alerts based on specific conditions. For example, you can use Alertmanager, which is part of the Prometheus ecosystem, to define and manage alerts.

Here are the steps to set up monitoring and alerting:

1. Set up Prometheus to scrape the metrics from oura and the app logs. You can use the Prometheus node exporter to scrape system metrics from the machine where oura is running, and you can use a custom exporter to scrape the last block hash parsed by oura and the last registered block hash in the app logs.
2. Set up Grafana to visualize the metrics. You can create a dashboard in Grafana that displays the last block hash parsed by oura and the last registered block hash in the app logs, and you can use Grafana's alerting feature to trigger alerts based on specific conditions.
3. Set up Alertmanager to manage the alerts. You can define alert rules in Alertmanager that trigger alerts when oura is not parsing blocks for some time, when oura errors occur, or when oura is down. You can also configure Alertmanager to send notifications to specific recipients, such as email, Slack, or PagerDuty, when an alert is triggered.

Here are some examples of alert rules that you can use:

* oura\_not\_parsing\_blocks: If the last block hash parsed by oura is older than a certain threshold (e.g., 5 minutes), trigger an alert.
* oura\_errors: If the number of oura errors exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 10 errors in 1 minute), trigger an alert.
* oura\_down: If oura is not running or is not reachable, trigger an alert.

By following these steps, you can monitor the last block hash parsed by oura and the last registered block hash in the app logs, and you can set up alerts for oura not parsing blocks for some time, oura errors, and oura being down."

and don’t have ad blockers enabled.
Conclusion:
During December we’ve noticed a slight decrease in website visitors, however the users have navigated more pages than in the previous month;
The organic visitors also increased, an explanation could be the blog posts and social activity that brings traffic;
On 13th December, the day we released 1.8.0, we can notice a spike in traffic - 418 uniques; on the same day there are significantly more new visitors than returning
On 8th, 9th and 14th December we can see a small spike in SEO unique users. However, upon checking the content calendar I can’t identify the reason.
I can notice data that is marked as ‘Other’ with regards to countries, top website pages and best performing content
In terms of conversion (when someone clicks on ‘Add to browser’ button on lace.io), we have a slight increase since November, with a high CVR of 38.96%;
The conversion time increase with approximately 2 minutes
Most of these unique visitors came to
http://lace.io
directly, followed by searching on Google, then Twitter, and
http://cardanocube.io
As expected, most of our visitors are from the USA, followed by Canada, Australia and the UK.
It seems that we gained more of the North America and Asia traffic, but decreased in Europe
.
The
most successful campaign is the HubSpot newsletter
The most accessed page is the homepage, as expected, followed by features, then FAQs.
Even more (30.6%) users than in the previous month (25%) now access
lace.io
via their mobile phones.

Conclusion:
Out of
273 new wallets
created in December,
we notice a spike on 10th and 21st December
;
Out of
513 restored wallets
, w
e can see a spike on 6th December, which coincides with Lenfi integration
, 8th and 9th December,
From the visible data in the Google Chrome Store (not all is visible yet), t
he highest number of uninstallations (19) occurred on 8th December, followed by 9th December (16).
Looking at the above mention, it looks like
due to the Lenfi integration
and comms we got more people from the community to install Lace, but then immediately abandoning our wallet;
The churn rate during this month is 31.31%, very high, though there is a very mild decrease
.
We are seeing
more restored wallets
(513) than
new wallets
created during this time (273). The number of connected hardware wallets is 200;
The onboarding process for a
new wallet
shows that out of
526 people
who clicked ‘agree’ for the analytics tracking,
500 continued
the process to add the
wallet’s name
,
15 people dropped off,
leaving
485 people
to create a
password for the wallet
,
4 dropped off at the recovery phrase screen,
481 continued.
18 people dropped off
writing down the
first batch of their recovery phrase, leaving 463 to write down the second batch of the words.
3 more people dropped of before writing down their third batch of the recovery phrase.
36 people dropped off
in total when it came to fill in the recovery phrase
, leaving 423 to complete
the whole process. The 24-word recovery phrase seems to be the biggest problem in completing the whole process. The process took on average
15 minutes.
This means we need to improve the onboarding process;
On 8th and 9th December we’ve noticed the
highest amount of token transactions - 333, and 247;
On 8th and 9th December we’ve noticed a high number of DAU - 812 and 808
,
while the
highest activity happened on 13th and 14th December, around the 1.8.0 release 824 and 832
. The first 2 dates need more investigation.
The installs came from
USA (1,352)
, followed by Other (unspecified country due to opt-out from analytics) (975), UK (374), Australia (234), Germany (212), Canada (198), Vietnam (183);

To improve the onboarding process and reduce the number of people dropping off during the recovery phrase step, the process needs to be simplified, and the 24-word recovery phrase should be made less daunting. This could involve breaking it down into smaller parts or providing more guidance and support during this step. Additionally, the onboarding process should be tested with a larger group of users to identify any other areas where people are dropping off and address those as well."

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary (overall project)
We want to simultaneously deal with 3 high priority VoC requests AND have feature parity with Nami, a worthy goal in itself and a pre-requisite for Nami User Migration. Note that Multi-Wallet/Multi-Account is by far the majority of the work.
Tying this back to Lace Business themes, this is hugely important for retention and e2e-experience. Foundational features that while perhaps not business winning in their own right, are important building blocks that more innovative features can build upon.
Risks/Concerns (overall project)
Specifically for multi-wallet/account, concerned that whenever you have a nested account structure (and multiple mnemonics) that the cognitive load on the user gets much higher. We’ll need to make sure that we’re very carefully considering UX here.
Does our analytics infrastructure support the custom tracking that is outlined in the following scopes? Do we have analytics tools where that data can live and be visualized (ie on a dasboard)?
Out of Scope (overall project)
Trezor Support (covered separately)
Migration of Nami users (different project)
Nami feature development (in Nami)
Phases
Phase 1: Multi-Wallet / Multi-Account
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Adding multi-wallet and multi-account support is a table stakes feature, with some users not able to switch to Lace due to our current deficit, and others quickly churning after onboarding
Scope: Multiple wallets
Users can add (create/restore/pair) multiple Cardano wallets
Users can seamlessly switch between different wallets
Users can easily see the current wallet’s name
Users can remove a wallet without affecting the other ones
[Analytics] Are users removing their wallets?
Scope: Multiple accounts
Users can enable/disable additional accounts on existing wallets
Users can easily see the current account’s name (and where it’s nested)
Users can switch between accounts.
[Analytics] Are users enabling/disabling accounts (indexing)? Are users switching between accounts?
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
Need crisp designs around this; it’s an important feature that many users have been asking for
Technical implementation seems relatively straightforward.
Wallet Analytics are
mostly
already covered with our current setup, but we should make sure they are comprehensive (are users adding additional wallets? are users switching between wallet? how active are multi-wallet users?)
Phase 2: Asset Search
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
…
Scope for this phase
Search in Token or NFT views via AssetName,
AssetID
or PolicyID
[Analytics] Custom tracking to see what searches people are making and on which pages (and maybe more broadly, are the searches showing results?):
Volo’s suggestion:
we can capture if a user started typing anything in a search input on a particular tab
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
Simple frontend feature - no external dependencies
Phase 3: Custom Submission Endpoint
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Currently in Lace, users have no control over where a txn is submitted (it just happens at the closest data center). This new feature lets users specify their own URL for submitting txns. They may want to use their local node, etc. This gives users (power users) control over their network. For example, this allows users to leverage a very fast node/connection.
Scope for this phase
Lace Settings allows user to enter a URL into a textbox
Validate for valid URL format
Possibly
: Probe URL to see if a service is responding
[Analytics] Custom tracking that lets us see how often this feature is used and what the txn ID is (added to our normal analytics).
Volo’s suggestion:
“
how often this feature is used
” - do we truly need it now? Can we do it later?
Volo’s suggestion:
from privacy perspective, not sure if it is OK to track what the txn ID is
[Analytics] Augment existing tracking to see whether this feature is being turned on:
Volo’s suggestion:
it seems it should be easy to track
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Imple
mentation Notes (incl
Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
Simple feature, no changes in SDK
Lace currently submits Tx via Ogmios. Custom Submission API
May need an additional service added to our backend
Phase 4: [Delighter] Setting an NFT as your avatar
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Simply, Nami users can do this and it’s a nice little customization. Small effort to go a long way in look/feel.
Scope for this phase
In an NFT viewing screen (or menu), there should be an option to “Set as [Avatar]” or “Set as Profile Picture”
[Analytics] How often are users doing this?
Volo’s suggestion:
it seems it should be easy to track
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
-
Success Criteria/KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
Lace Extension has 100% feature parity with Nami
No additional user complaints/concerns about lacking these features (especially in relation to Nami)
Utilization (are users discovering/using this feature?
10% of Users set their profile picture
10% of Users create multiple wallets/accounts
Custom submission endpoint is used successfully in transactions
10% Growth in acquisition rate

Introduction & Main use cases
Introduction
Lace aspires to be the best Cardano wallet. While it has introduced some unique advances, it still lacks a few key features that many Cardano wallet applications already offer. Support for multiple wallets and multiple accounts are some of them, allowing users to manage wallets and accounts for different purposes within the same application.
Main use cases and their importance
Although there are multiple use cases for multiple wallets and multiple accounts, we’ll cover the main use case for each, and why it is important for Lace to support them:
Multiple wallets: HODL + Spending
Many users have two wallets, one for HODLing, which is usually a hardware wallet, with extra security, and another for day-to-day transactions. Ad-hoc wallets are also popular for quickly receiving funds and participating in NFT drops.
By supporting multiple accounts, we increase the chance these users will migrate to Lace.
Multiple accounts: multi-delegation
While Lace offers a more seamless multi-delegation solution, users can do so in other wallets by using multiple accounts, although it incurs more fees.
Until we support multiple accounts, users with this kind of multi-delegation can’t use Lace.

When dealing with a nested account structure and multiple mnemonics, the cognitive load on the user can become much higher. It is crucial to ensure that the user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to seamlessly switch between different wallets and accounts.

Moreover, it’s providing a better user experience, eliminating the need to go via other parties. Our competition also provides this feature (Eternl, Flint, Yoroi, Vespr, etc).

Summary
Banxa offers three checkout options
Global Checkout: This will be our generic Banxa checkout link that merchants will use to link out to Banxa checkout. The experience and journey will be the same each time. Due to simplicity, it is fastest to market.
Custom Checkout: Consumers will go through the merchant comparison and selection process before they are redirected to Banxa checkout. This journey is partially owned by the merchant. Our best and most complex offering.
Widget Checkout: Consumers will complete the checkout with Banxa via a Widget (iFrame) whilst remaining on the merchant website. This is a good balance between speed of integration and user experience.
As part of phase 1, we’ve selected the
Global Checkout
option for an MVP due to technical simplicity and ensuring the fastest time to market. The simple approach will provide essential insights to optimize the user journey as we gracefully aim to transition towards bespoke Custom Checkout (Option 2).
Long term
In the future, we aim to offer users an embedded experience to Banxa’s services as part of the Laces feature set enabling users to buy and sell ADA directly in the wallet. We plan to integrate Banxa’s API and connect it to our own embedded UI in Lace. For KYC and payment confirmation steps where the widget redirect is required, we’d require Banxa to customize their widget UI to provide a seamless experience for our users.
Short term
The first phase considers a more straightforward approach, i.e., a URL parametrization Referral Link. There will be no need to make API calls, nor does it require bespoke embedded design; instead, it provides low technical complexity while maintaining a high-impact outcome for end users. The experience and journey will be the same each time. Due to its simplicity, it is the fastest method to market.
Users will be directed to the Banxa order page which will be pre-filled with any parameters that were passed through. We can use this integration option if we do not require webhooks or price comparison within Lace.
Note
: Banxa confirmed that they have successfully assisted numerous partners through Google Play and Apple App Store registration process with respect to Banxa’s on/off ramp service, and will supply a compliance letter in support of Lace’s application when needed

Feature promise
A hassle-free experience, allowing users to buy ADA with fiat currencies and improving the accessibility for new and existing lace users to get started in Web3.
A streamlined experience allow users to buy AND sell ADA for fiat currencies
Customer pain points
Users lack a convenient way to quickly on-ramp and get started with Lace
Lace isers must have a way to sell ADA if they decide to otherwise we’ve created a new pain-point.
Product proof points
Users will experience a simple process to On Ramp and quickly get started in Web3, resulting  in an increase of user satisfaction and retention.
Fiat On/Off Ramp  simplifies conversion processes, eliminating unnecessary complexities and providing a straightforward experience for users to Buy and Sell ADA
Pricing
Banxa provides what you see is what you get quotations for end users. This price will cover everything from payment gateway fees, blockchain/network fees, Banxa fees, foreign exchange fees and tax.
As an example, if the payment method specifies a fee of 4.5%, you would receive $955 USDT from $1000 of USD ($45 in total fees).
The customer will not be charged more during the checkout journey with Banxa from the initial price that they see on the quotations page. Other on-ramps may show a lower fee for payment gateways and network fees, giving the impression that it is cheaper, but would later mark up the quotation later in the checkout journey. We do not work this way.
Additionally, we can create custom price arrangements and provide Banxa fee discounts for different volume ranges. As an example, if the payment method specifies a fee of 4.5%, you would receive $955 USDT from $1000 of USD ($45 in total fees).

Strategy
We believe that XSY, an innovative liquidity accelerator infrastructure (or Liquidity OS), is born at the right time, and in the right economic context. With a
soft launch
in early in 2024, we plan to address the industry’s pain points, and capture valuable information to better enhance our services.
XSY will deploy
brand awareness marketing initiatives in its first 6 months
to test product-market fit for a PoC service, which can be used as an use case.
Ultimately, we need to achieve our long-term goals:
Accelerate economic activity (EA)
Accelerate money velocity (MV)

"Introduction
Why the world
improvement
in the subject?
A
local testnet
is just a development tool, so it has mainly two requirements:
it must satisfy test cases requirements;
it should make the developers life quality as high as possible.
Our
local tesnet
(part of
cardano-js-sdk
) more than meets the first requirement while has a couple of problems about the second one:
it is not always so easy to update it to satisfy new test cases;
it is built using more standards: mixed yaml and json configuration files, mixed bash and JavaScript scripts...
its main issue is
it takes a dozen of minutes, at each run, to be ready
;
the main purpose of this proposal is to improve our
local tesnet
on these sides.
Core change proposal
The reason for the ~12' delay at startup is to let some epochs to go; some test cases requires this scenario.
The idea which originated this proposal is to
move
the activity performed inside the
testnet
from the
initial stage
of
docker run
phase to the
docker build
phase.
Implementation details
The structure of the network itself (more working
cardano-node
daemons with ad hoc network configuration and genesis) is pretty good, no changes on this side are planned.
Create a new TypeScript script which governs the
testnet
in all stages of its lifetime:
initialization: download and patch the network configuration and genesis files;
start up
and
shut down
the
cardano-node
s with the required customizations both for the
docker build
and the
docker run
phases;
perform the actions (i.e. submit the transactions) during the
docker build
phase to create all the required test cases;
Expose everything required to interact with the
testnet
(the socket, the mnemonics, the submitted tx ids to let the tests to know which are the txs concurring in creating the required test cases, the stake pool ids with their expected status, etc…) through a
docker volume
.
Side changes proposals
Publish on ghcr.io
Currently the
local testnet
is build through
docker compose
at each startup (
docker cache
helps saving time here) and it doesn’t exists as its own.
One more interesting improvement could be to publish it on ghcr.io .
Pros
One single build can serve all the developers.
SDK CI tests can download the pre-built image to save time on this side as well.
It can be used by other teams, also from outside IOG.
Cons
Requires more development time.
New dedicated github repository
Obviously, if the decision is not to publish it on ghcr.io, this makes no sense as the files need to live in the SDK repository.
On the other hand, an open source published docker image may deserves a dedicated repository to isolate documentation and support requests and to facilitate the contribution from the open source community.",How can the local testnet's long startup time and complex build process be improved through moving activities to the docker build phase and potentially publishing it on ghcr.io?,"The local testnet's long startup time can be improved by moving activities from the initial stage of the docker run phase to the docker build phase. This would involve creating a new TypeScript script that governs the testnet in all stages of its lifetime, including initialization, start up and shut down of the cardano-node daemons, performing actions during the docker build phase to create required test cases, and exposing necessary information through a docker volume. Additionally, publishing the local testnet on ghcr.io could further improve the build process by allowing a single build to serve all developers, saving time for SDK CI tests, and making it available for use by other teams. However, this would require more development time and a new dedicated github repository."
"Danilo Prates
Rhys Bartels Waller",What is the significance of mentioning both Danilo Prates and Rhys Bartels Waller in this context?,"The context does not provide enough information to determine the significance of mentioning both Danilo Prates and Rhys Bartels Waller. It is unclear who these individuals are, what their relationship is to each other, or why they are being mentioned together. Without additional context, it is not possible to determine the significance of their mention."

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary (overall project)
DJED offers a blend of stability and decentralization. Designed to mitigate cryptocurrency volatility, DJED maintains a stable value, facilitating reliable transactions, and serving as a dependable medium for savings and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Leveraging Cardano's secure and scalable platform, promises lower transaction costs and enhanced efficiency. By integrating DJED into the lace wallet we believe [
hypothesis
], we will increase it’s usage by streamlining the experience from the get go at the moment any users creates/recovers a wallet in lace.
Risks/Concerns (overall project)
The integration of DJED and SHEN into the Lace wallet involves complex interactions between various components, including the user interface, the Cardano blockchain, and the smart contract itself. This complexity can lead to technical challenges such as interoperativility, scalability and synchronization issues.
Out of Scope (overall project)
NA
Phases
(note: there might be only one phase!)
Phase 1: Dev work + Design process
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
Lace wallet represents means to an end, the gateway to entering the Cardano space. DJED is the key to access all the DEFI universe of possibilities within our ecosystem. By merging these two projects, we believe we can increase visibility, onboard new users and full seamless DEFI experience in Cardano. In order to achieve this, we require work in two different fronts:
Front and back-end effort
Design effort
There are several questions that arise regarding what’s the best experience we can provide by integrating Djed into lace. Therefore, we need to go through a discovery process so we can properly define such UX and UI. Both effort can run in parallel.
Scope for this phase
Add support on the cardano-js-sdk for plutus scripts
Implement function to compute transaction body scriptDataHash
Expose endpoint in the SDK to compute execution units
Update input selection to support adding arbitrary inputs as part of the selection result
Update the transaction builder to support Plutus scripts
DJED Specific work on the SDK
Track liquidity
Track the state of the DJED smart contract
Contract Interaction
Work on the wallet
Discovery research process
Design and create Lace UI/UX in Lace based on research conclusion
Out of Scope for this phase
NA
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
The work to do in the front-end is straight forward, we might require more support for the back-end
Should we build a solution sharable with the ecosystem so others wallets also support DJED?

Summary
On the
31 Jan 2024
Nami v3.7.0
was released, marking the first release since the IOG acquisition. All manual testing was successful, before and after the release, however some hours into the Chrome extension rollout phase, access to the backend API (Blockfrost) was failing due to the wrong API account key used in the build, and subsequent rate limiting in effect. After being notified in the Lace support channel of users discussing the outage in X (Twitter), the issue was diagnosed and ultimately service restored by re-provisioning the account receiving the API requests from Nami v3.7.0.
The intent of this release was to make a minimal update to:
Comply with IOG legal standards
Replace visual references from Berry Pool
Rework the delegation feature to not have Berry Pool as the only option
Remove legacy
testnet
option
Instrument the application for collecting anonymous analytics to better assess the user activity to develop a migration to Lace plan.
A decision was made to
not
fix legacy bugs, and
not
improve build or release processes, since there’s uncertainty on how we will proceed with retaining or incorporating the UX of Nami into Lace, which will be mostly be driven by data collected
after
this release has been made. It was however brought to our attention that the analytics implementation was potentially in violation of
article 7(3) of the GDPR
, as there was no feature to opt-out of the original decision made buy the user to opt-in.
Impact
Affected users were unable to sync chain state changes or submit transactions between the hours of
2130-0000
on
31 Jan 2024
and
0455-0824
on
01 Feb 2024
. Funds were secure and users could access the network via alternative wallet software, including Lace, which is a good backup strategy in general.

Resolved by increasing the account capacity
. Also notification of the root cause
Total Requests to the security@iohk.io Blockfrost account (UTC+1)
Root Cause Analysis
Why did the API requests fail?
A valid but under-provisioned account key was used rather than the expected Nami account key, which is a
starter plan
key limited to 50k/reqs per day.
Why was this not discovered during pre-release testing?
The key provides identical access if the limit is not exceeded, and testing does not deplete the request balance.
Chrome extensions are rolled out to users over a number of hours, and the sanity checks were performed soon after the rollout began, before the account limit was reached.
How did the wrong API key get used?
All secret material is stored in VaultWarden, which is a shared service with users in various chapters and tribes. Prior to the Nami acquisition, an existing record was stored in the vault as below:
Contributing Factors
:
This record contained no username, which
could
have been set as the account identifier
security@iohk.io
to better identify it.
It was global and not restricted to only users who require access, presumably members of the security team.
Nami credentials were expected to be available in VaultWarden, and this vague record was assumed to be for Nami. Once it was set and demonstrated to be working, there was no reason to question its validity. The mistake was made during migration of credentials, where clearly the Nami account Blockfrost keys were not added to VaultWarden.
Why did we not notice the issue independently?
Nami uses Blockfrost as its backend, which has some level of monitoring from a service provider’s perspective, but its geared towards ensuring account capacity is sufficient rather than alerting based on usage patterns.
Why did it take ~6hrs for a response?
Posts made to the
#lace-support
channel are not covered by our on-call team and the timing meant it would be attended when eastern Europeans started their day.
Why was the notification made to the
#lace-support
channel rather than triggering an on-call response?
There is not an established process for communicating a potential service disruption since we have monitoring in place for Lace via the backend services we control.
Corrective Action Plan
Promote the
security@iohk.io
account to the same provisioning as
nami@iohk.io
Rename the vague VaultWarden item to avoid confusion in future
Request all items added to VaultWarden contain enough detail to properly identify account keys, and limit items to be added to the global space.
Add the missing item for Nami Blockfrost keys
Define a formal incident response plan, including notifying legal, and triggering an on-call response.
Create a crisis response plan, with input from legal.
Chrome extensions can be
configured for partial rollout
, as a percentage. We should investigate strategies to minimise impact in future, using the initial cohort to verify the update is not causing a disruption.
Automate the build in a GitHub workflow to reduce the chance of API key mismatch in future, and reduce the risk associated with building locally, plus make it auditable.
Update Nami to use the intended account API key
Demote the
security@iohk.io
account back to a starter plan once the update has rolled out completely.
Consider a notification hook feature in Blockfrost to set thresholds of expected usage per API endpoint. This could feed into our existing monitoring system to alert operations teams of the issue in real time.
Consider improvements in social network monitoring to improve reaction time.","What was the primary factor that led to the API request failure in the Nami v3.7.0 release, and how can it be addressed in the future to prevent similar issues?","The primary factor that led to the API request failure in the Nami v3.7.0 release was the use of a valid but under-provisioned account key, specifically the starter plan key for security@iohk.io, which was limited to 50k/reqs per day. This key was used instead of the expected Nami account key, and since testing does not deplete the request balance, the issue was not discovered during pre-release testing.

        To prevent similar issues in the future, the following actions can be taken:

        1. Ensure that the correct account key is used for API requests by double-checking the key during the migration of credentials and adding Nami account Blockfrost keys to VaultWarden.
        2. Request all items added to VaultWarden to contain enough detail to properly identify account keys and limit items to be added to the global space.
        3. Define a formal incident response plan, including notifying legal, and triggering an on-call response to ensure a faster response time in case of similar issues.
        4. Consider a notification hook feature in Blockfrost to set thresholds of expected usage per API endpoint, which could feed into the existing monitoring system to alert operations teams of the issue in real time.
        5. Automate the build in a GitHub workflow to reduce the chance of API key mismatch in future, and reduce the risk associated with building locally, plus make it auditable.
        6. Update Nami to use the intended account API key.

Post-release
Determine if a situation warrants being escalated to an incident
Identify the incident
Analyze the severity level","For the Lace Tribe's incident guide, what are the specific steps for defining the rotation of team members responsible for handling incidents, both before and after product release?","Before product release, the Lace Tribe should define who is going to be in charge and who’s on the rotation for handling incidents. To define the rotation, the Lace Tribe should consider the following steps:

        1. Identify all team members who have the necessary skills and expertise to handle incidents.
        2. Determine the number of team members needed for the rotation based on the expected volume and complexity of incidents.
        3. Establish a schedule for the rotation, specifying the start and end times for each team member’s shift.
        4. Communicate the rotation schedule to all team members and ensure they understand their responsibilities.
        5. Provide training and resources to team members to ensure they are prepared to handle incidents effectively.

        After product release, the Lace Tribe should continue to maintain the rotation of team members responsible for handling incidents. To do this, the Lace Tribe should consider the following steps:

        1. Monitor the volume and complexity of incidents to ensure that the rotation schedule is still appropriate.
        2. Adjust the rotation schedule as needed to ensure that team members are not overworked or underutilized.
        3. Continuously provide training and resources to team members to ensure they are up-to-date on the latest incident handling techniques and tools.
        4. Regularly review the incident handling process to identify areas for improvement and make necessary changes.
        5. Recognize and reward team members for their contributions to incident handling, which can help to maintain morale and motivation."

Transaction Representation improvement
(click for more details)
Our current Tx representation looks wrong or incomplete in several scenarios. This area is quite important given that most Lace’s traffic come from DApps, and majority of scams are carried out through the DApp bridge. As of now, users that interact with dapps can’t see the whole view of what the Tx is carrying, not knowing what exactly they’re signing. This situation opens up many scenarios where the user is subject to fraud, which as a financial product raises deep concerns. Recent events in Cardano ecosystem have highlighted the weakness of wallets protecting users, including Lace.  Here are some example of recent events:
-
Wallet drained 1
(mint case)
-
Wallet drained 2
465k ADA stolen (NFT gift ADA drop scam)
-
Wallet drained 3
101k ADA stolen + NFTs (mint case)
- Discussion thread 1
""This is a wallet UX issue""
-
Discussion thread 2
""
We’re not ready for mass adoption.""

Discussion thread 3

Discussion thread 4
""Cardano wallets implement better TX previews and potentially even warning messages for when suspicious Txs arrive""
While all Cardano wallets are exposed to this problem, Lace is currently behind top wallets.
This feature addresses part of the concerns voiced by the community in the fundamental base (possible and recommended to add more features on top). It’s composed of many small improvements that overall create a large impact of the dapp interaction experience. The scope has been split in three phases to deliver incremental value.
In Lace 1.10 we are releasing Phase 1 out of 3, which looks at:
Add a summary in the DApp bridge (wallet connect/ DApp connector) of all assets involved in the Tx from the wallet POV, summarizing to users what are the changes about to be executed on their wallet
Add NFTs thumbnails to the DApp bridge summary
Add collateral information to the DApp bridge, supporting former and output collateral types
Remove address redundancies in input/output sections: show only addresses in one section
By the end of this phase, in the DApp bridge of Lace, users will be able to easily read all asset information carried in the Tx requested to be signed, having a clean summary of assets being exchanged from the wallet POV, including thumbnails for NFTs and support for the new collateral output.

The improvements include adding a summary in the DApp bridge of all assets involved in the transaction from the wallet point of view, summarizing to users what are the changes about to be executed on their wallet. NFTs thumbnails will also be added to the DApp bridge summary, and collateral information will be added to support former and output collateral types. Additionally, address redundancies in input/output sections will be removed, showing only addresses in one section.

This information can inform the design of the migration process and help ensure that it is user-friendly and meets user expectations. The proposed channels and methods for capturing user feedback include surveys, interviews, focus groups, and user testing. These methods can be used to gather both quantitative and qualitative data, which can be analyzed to identify trends and patterns in user feedback. It is important to involve relevant stakeholders, such as Danilo Prates, Ian Cross, Rodolpho Ribeiro, and the legal department, in the user research process to ensure that the research is aligned with business objectives and legal requirements. Additionally, creating Jira tasks for the Marcomms and Ecosystem teams can help ensure that user feedback is captured and addressed in a timely and effective manner."

Conclusion:
During January we’ve noticed a
significant decrease in unique users
and overall activity on the website.
29.5% less uniques and 31.5% less SEO generated visitors
have visited
lace.io
, which is expected after a longer period of not publishing new content on our blog/ website.
Most traffic is direct (1,515), followed by google (702). We’ve seen a slight increase in traffic generated  from
Namiwallet.io
.
We’ve also noticed an increase in visitors arriving on
lace.io
via a logo placed on
adahandle.com
On January 8th we’ve release a hotfix, Lace 1.8.1, and that generated a bit more traffic from twitter.
There is a decrease of 21.9% in the unique website visitors that ‘added lace to their browser’, however, the
conversion rate still remains above average at 36.05%.
From this month’s data, we can see some moderate spikes in unique users on the following days: 3rd January (128), 10th (115), 25th (106). This month’s been quieter and we’ve not had content to correlate to these slight increases in traffic.
The conversion time slightly decreased by 1 minute
As expected, most of our visitors are from the USA, followed by Indonesia, Canada, Australia and the UK.
It seems that we gained more of the North America and Asia traffic, but decreased in Europe
.
The
most successful campaign is the Nami banner on our homepage
The most accessed page is the homepage, as expected, followed by features, then FAQs.

        - Grellow: 2 squad leads, 3 SDETs, and 10 developers (total 15 members, -1 compared to the current distribution)
        
        The impact on the SDET role in each squad is as follows:
        - Blorange: The number of SDETs in the Blorange squad will increase from 2 to 3, indicating a greater emphasis on testing and quality assurance within this squad.
        - Yellow: The number of SDETs in the Yellow squad will remain the same at 3, suggesting a consistent focus on testing and quality assurance within this squad.
        - Grellow: The number of SDETs in the Grellow squad will also remain the same at 3, indicating a consistent focus on testing and quality assurance within this squad.
        
        In summary, the proposed squad changes will result in a slight increase in the number of team members in the Blorange squad, while the number of team members in the Yellow and Grellow squads will remain relatively unchanged. The number of SDETs in each squad will also remain relatively consistent, indicating a continued focus on testing and quality assurance across all three squads."

"Background
The
https://github.com/input-output-hk/lace-mobile
repository is our starting point, which was the codebase setup as part of the Lace mobile POC skunkworks project, running from February 2023 to October 2023, where it was parked due to strategy changes within IOG.

The
design
implements layering based on
DDD
, supporting the development of headless features in isolation that can then be applied in various applications, both multiple platforms for Lace, and also entirely different wallet applications such as Nami.
The key management architecture is considerate of
multi-chain requirements
, so can therefore be considered for extension to support additional chains.
There’s been an intention to move some arguably Lace-centric functionality, that was written into the
cardano-js-sdk
, into Lace, to remove friction associated with the isolated SDLC. This includes both frontend and backend aspects.
Summary
After completing some codebase chores, to remove the specificity as this being constrained to a mobile version of Lace, and reviewing the architecture to ensure it stands up the new project requirements, the backend source code will be moved and deployed continuously for the
dev-*
environments. Wallet code from the SDK will also be moved in and the packages published for the legacy codebase to consume during for the interim. From here a minimum browser extension will be setup, bringing parity to the two applications present, with a semi-automated release process similar to the
cardano-js-sdk
, and then the list of supported chains extended to include Midnight Shielded. The final stage of this project then is focused on bringing across the remaining features, one-by-one, eventually being able to release a version of Lace extension for Cardano from the new codebase.
While the primary focus is on the browser extension, depending on capacity, we could also re-initiate the mobile development in parallel as soon as the lower level domain elements are implemented.
Phases
1 - Prepare
Rename GitHub repository to
lace-mc
(Lace multi-chain) or
xsy-wallet
. The latter better suits sourcing multiple wallet products, including Lace and Nami.
Rework documentation to position the mobile product as just one application
Upgrade dependencies
Enforce Conventional Commits via GitHub workflow
Conventional Commits training material (
Piotr Czeglik
)
Perform architecture review, challenging the design to ensure it covers the new requirements of adding a Lace browser extension an potentially a Nami rebuild.
Define engineering SOPs
All members part of
lace-activity
Slack channel, user account associated with GitHub account
In context PR discussion happens in this channel using the threads created by the bot (not in squad channels)
2 - Migrate SDK Code
Common
Finalise any open PRs relating to the code we’re about to move
The provider interfaces
e2e tests
Local network caching to remove dead 25mins of setup, maybe with S3 now it’s higer perf.
These will be considered integration tests in the context of Lace
Backend
Migrate
cardano-services
from the SDK repo into
lace-mc
as
backend
Switch
lace-ops
to use this as the source, which should be a drop-in replacement
Setup continuous deployment for dev environments, using branch merge as the trigger:
dev-sanchonet
dev-preview
dev-preprod
dev-mainnet
Simple configuration - Developer friendly
Full local development environment with a local network removing the strict dependency on public testnets.
Frontend
wallet package
web-extension
Publish package under
@lace
, or
@xsywallet
, namespace for consumption in the existing Lace codebase during the transition.
3 - Limited Feature Migration
Chain selector
Onboarding flow
Create wallets, activate accounts
View wallet
Send/Receive
Critical chain-specific backend config
4 - Initiate Midnight Shielded  (In parallel with phase 3)
Local proof server setup
With the basic features implemented, including the chain selector, extend to support Midnight Shielded Ledger.
Use a feature flag
5 - Finalise and release browser extension Cardano
All remaining features from the Lace product migrated here.
The goal is to have the whole team move across to be developing in this codebase.
The architecture is sympathetic to parallel features being developed concurrently
6 - Mobile Feature Parity (Cardano only, in parallel with phase 3 and 4)
This development could be continued in parallel with phase 3, after a small offset, implementing the lower level components being written to support the browser extension.

Exec Summary
Project Execution Summary -
We have 6 weeks left until the end of PI5. In that time, we expect to cut at least 2-3 more releases, which will capture a large majority of remaining planned work.
Nami bug resolution
is on track from the XSY side of things with ticket resolution comms in approval and bug fix merged and awaiting audit.
Starting off the work required for the Nami Migration tool. Regardless of CH opinion on nami-mode, this will still be valuable work. The shared wallets beta will be descoped in order to bring this effort in.
As mentioned in previous update, finishing up a significant re-work of our epics in progress to focus on MVPs. Lots of unnecessary work was trimmed without much impact to the product delivery.
Important meetings with midnight leadership this week - need to understand longer term timelines.

Lace v1.9: Slack channel for Progress Graphs
20 Feb 2024
Current scope of the v1.9 release has been amended to: Multi-Wallet / Multi-Account + One tranche (out of 3) of Tx Rep Improvements
Lace Heads Trio met today and cut Trezor Support plus less-urgent elements of Multi-Wallet / Multi-Account out of v1.9, producing the scope cuts & improved timing prospects visible in the graphs. Slack write-up visible in the xsy-lace channel

Scope of v1.10 is increasing as work is removed from v1.9, eg Trezor Mappers and Multi-Wallet/Multi-Account are in v1.10 scope. Once we are on the home straight for v1.9 we will need to revisit v1.10 scope, which is now probably too large

Sept 2023 (?): this was thought to be a relatively simple project at kick off, & was originally undertaken by Green & Yellow Squads (

We are still at 2 tickets containing technical work (which should be completed in <1 week from now
), and one to represent Audit work
There is ‘politics’ around the Audit:
Rhys Bartels Waller
is in discussion with
Brandon Wolf
, but currently it looks like we
will
do the Audit, and that will take “6-8 weeks”, so possibly taking us into March
Given that in January, when the priority of this project was raised, Best Guess was “done by end of Jan”,
we are already considerably behind forecast delivery date
.  About half of the projected delay to March is down to the Audit.

Tx Rep Improvements Phase 1: Slack channel for Progress Graphs
Forecast effort: -
Background
Our current Tx representation is incomplete: most of Lace’s traffic come from DApps, and majority of scams are carried out through the DApp bridge. Security enhancements will provide additional trust in Lace and reduce successful fraud/malicious txn attempts.
Since Jan 2024 this has been worked on as Project Prio #3 (after Nami work & Trezor)
19 Feb 2024
The second tranche (of 3) of this project is in scope for Lace Browser v1.9, and as per that section of the document the likely shipping date is now moving towards mid-March

Adding multi-wallet and multi-account support is a table stakes feature, with some users not able to switch to Lace due to our current deficit, and others quickly churning after onboarding
This was conceived of, refined & prioritised (not before time, many would say) in ~Oct/Nov 2023, soon after the Nami acquisition, as part of “Nami Feature Parity” (considered a pre-requisite for “Nami User Migration”)

Since late January, when v1.9 provisional scope was i) broadly agreed ii) did not include Shared Wallets (ie it was deprioritised relative to 1.9), this has had almost no work done on it

Background:
Daedalus is a full node wallet with current supported node being v 1.35.4 and using IOG relays for blockchain sync.  Daedalus needs to be updated to support the next Hard Fork called Chang HF and also support using relays via P2P protocol.
Also there is a requirement to update various libraries to latest versions due to security vulnerabilities.
19 Feb 2024
* Required updates for the next Daedalus release will be defined not later than 23 Feb 2024
* Session scheduled for 21 Feb 2024 to define requirements

This was not in the Lace PI Plan
. The Core Team pinged Lace during that planning process, and we only decided what to do about it subsequent to the PI5 presentation.
Marius Bock
, has anyone set/got any expectations about this?
27 Feb 2024
Session was held to define requirement for the update:
P2P support readiness
Hard Fork readiness
Update of vulnerable libraries and packages
Ongoing discussions of what node version should be supported.  The current release node version is 8.7.3 that neither support P2P or Hard Fork readiness.
From Core Tech, it looks like 8.9.1 is the version that should be targetted.
Regarding QA resourcing.  From discussions with QA Lead, we have QA resource that covers all 3 platforms ie Windows, Linux and MacOS.  However, it should be noted that to regression test on Daedalus can take up to 5 working days.
04 Mar 2024
Currently there is an issue with Trezor Hardware wallet integration after Daedalus was build with the new cardano-node and cardano-wallet
Investigation is under way to resolved this
It is currently targetted to get the release out by end of March.
Latest update
18 Mar 2024
Trezor integration issue has been resolved
Work is continuing on upgrading vulnerable packages
New cardano-node 8.9.0 has been released and waiting on timeline from Cardano Foundation on when cardano-wallet will support this release.
It is currently targetted to get the release out by end of March depending on results from full regression test..
This was not in the Lace PI Plan
. The Core Team pinged Lace during that planning process, and we only decided what to do about it subsequent to the PI5 presentation.

-The current terms of use is not compliant with IOG’s legal standards.
-There is no privacy policy to review and approve as part of the onboarding.
-All supporting properties also require tweaks, such as the website and Chrome store listing, as they’re referencing Berry pool or below IOG legal standards.
-Delegations are made directly to Berry pool, which remains the property of Alesandro.
-We have no insight on the usage of Nami, given there’s no analytics in place.
-The release aims to address the above issues, in a minimal way, removing the legal risk and allowing users to delegate to any pool. We also gain intelligence into the current usage patterns, allowing us to plan the user migration with data backed decisions.
Under a heading of “further Nami-related work” we have a goal of “migrate many thousands of users”, but we do not currently know what a reasonable success would look like in terms of numbers migrated nor timescales.

So to keep building and maintaining an engaged community within XSY/Lace, I’ve decided to outline some of our current costs plus potential additional costs if a rough budget – ring-fenced, of USD2,500 per year is approved.
If the current budget is to be moved/allocated to XSY, it’s important to bear in mind the existing costs covered by IOG.
Current Discord Running Costs
(covered by IOG)
Jira ticket for existing procurement request:
Discord Nitro subscription for community manager ($99.99/year)
DIscord Lace server boosts ($52/month)
Bots ($8/month)
Total: approximately
$717/year.
Proposed Additional Costs
Additional bots ($99/per year): for added stats and analytics, engagement initiatives and gamification)
Kahoot! 360 Pro subscription ($740/year): for quizzes and interactive presentations. Can be used for engagement initiatives but also Product masterclasses
Total: additional
$839/year.
Giveaways/Airdrops/Merch costs
Estimated $1,000 in merch and competitions, including postage and handling costs.
Revenue Option
Given that Lace has a very appealing branding, we could upload our designs and other assets to the merch platform
https://www.spreadshop.com/merchandise-creator
, in order to offset some of our marketing costs mentioned above.","""What would be the total annual cost for the proposed Discord upgrades and engagement initiatives, assuming a budget of USD2,500 per year, with approximately $717 currently covered by IOG and an estimated $1,000 for merch and competitions?""","The total annual cost for the proposed Discord upgrades and engagement initiatives, assuming a budget of USD2,500 per year, with approximately $717 currently covered by IOG and an estimated $1,000 for merch and competitions, would be $2,500 - $717 - $1,000 = $833. This amount includes the proposed additional costs of $839/year for additional bots and a Kahoot! 360 Pro subscription, minus the $8/month for bots that is already covered by IOG. The remaining budget of $833 can be used for other engagement initiatives or marketing costs."

analytics
DappRadar is useful to both users and developers. Developers get access to important information such as
user behaviour, competition, and market movements
. Knowing all this, they can enhance their own Dapps and provide better user experiences.
Lace DApp Store MVP doesn’t yet offer access to user behaviour and data regarding usage/ competition
Real-time metrics
This tool enables
real-time insights and up-to-date information on a variety of metrics
such as transaction volumes, token usage, and user activity. This helps users in making timely and informed decisions according to the current state of the crypto market.
Our application does no offer this capability

User-friendly interface
Complex interface
DappRadar includes a user interface that is
not really beginner-friendly
. For newcomers, it might appear complex to navigate.
Easy-to-use interface
for seasoned pros and newcomers
Machine learning algorithm
DappRadar
uses on-chain data to track and analyse the performance of Dapps
. At the same time, it
tracks data manually and uses machine learning algorithms to optimise it.
Machine learning algorithms are also used to
provide users with estimates of the value of their NFTs.
Our product doesn’t have scoped such a feature
Certifications
DappRadar doesn’t show any certification levels in their interface for the displayed DApps
For this iteration certifications are out of scope. However, the plan is to allow developers to add existing audit reports and we’ll display them as
Level 0.
We believe that with this feature users can choose higher security DApps.
Ranking system
It employs a categorisation and ranking system that aids users in exploring Dapps according to their needs and preferences. The system lays down Dapps into specific categories such as finance, gaming, and more.
Each Dapp gets its ranking based on key factors such as transaction volume and user engagement
.
For this iteration the ranking system is out of scope. However, the next iterations are exploring
community reviews/ ranking/ curation
.
We believe that our system is more decentralized and offers a realistic curation

Firstly, DappRadar's interface, while not beginner-friendly, offers a more comprehensive set of features and tools for experienced users. This includes real-time metrics, on-chain registration for DApps, and a categorization and ranking system for DApps. In contrast, the Lace DApp Store MVP has a simpler interface that is easier to navigate but lacks some of these advanced features.

        Secondly, DappRadar's comprehensive NFT valuation and portfolio management capabilities are a significant differentiator. This feature allows users to manage their NFT collections and get accurate valuations for their assets. While the Lace DApp Store MVP does not currently offer NFT management capabilities, it is something that could be added in future iterations.

        Finally, DappRadar's data-led reporting and thought leadership in the industry set it apart from other DApp stores. DappRadar's reports and insights are widely respected and often cited in the media, giving the company a level of authority and credibility that is hard to match. The Lace DApp Store MVP, on the other hand, is still in the early stages of development and has not yet established itself as a thought leader in the industry.

        Overall, DappRadar's user-friendly interface, comprehensive NFT valuation, and data-led reporting make it a strong competitor in the DApp store market. While the Lace DApp Store MVP has some advantages, such as its focus on decentralization and community-driven ecosystem, DappRadar's more advanced features and industry authority give it a significant edge. However, as the Lace DApp Store MVP continues to evolve and add new features, it may become a more formidable competitor in the future."

Exec Summary
There are several challenges we’ve identified as part of our lace analytics refactor initiative, particularly around manual updates, tracking complexities, discrepancies in user counts, and onboarding drop-ins and drop-offs. The problem space describes the inefficiency of manually updating Google Chrome Store metrics, complexities in tracking opt-ins versus opt-outs for anonymous analytics, discrepancies between the total number of users and those segmented by country, and challenges monitoring user drop-off post-onboarding. Additionally, it concerns the uncertainty surrounding the data storage solution, possibly PostHog's data warehouse, and the need for further investigation into data integrity and reporting accuracy.
By taking a first principles approach we decompose the problem into its purest form to successfully reactor lace-analytics. The explanation below describes the relationship between each phase and the most common dependencies among these stages.
Moreover, the proposed strategy introduces a, risk-mitigated approach to deploying new features to Lace users, incorporating canary releases, tiered feature flags, A/B testing, and PostHog Surveys. By initially releasing updates to a select group of users and employing feature flags for a controlled rollout, the strategy allows for close monitoring of performance against key metrics, ensuring minimal impact on user experience. Tiered feature flags enable a segmented release process, targeting specific user tiers like highly active users for a more tailored approach. A/B testing provides critical insights by comparing user responses to different feature versions. At the same time, PostHog Surveys offer a deeper understanding of user sentiment, both of which are instrumental in refining and optimizing features. This integrated framework provides a user-centric, data-driven feature rollout, enhancing user satisfaction and adoption rates.
Business Understanding
The business understanding phase is essential because it helps stakeholders and the team understand what we’re working with and the resources available for example.
Available resources? (Data engineers/scientist, data-infrastructure, tools, budget)
What are the primary problems? And how to best approach the problem given the available resources we have today.
What are the primary goals?
Data Understanding
This step involves granting access to the essential individuals required to review the data, explore the tables and determine whether the available existing data is sufficient enough to answer the questions we seek to answer.
Review existing data sources, Google Chrome Store metrics and PostHog Analytics.
Assess data quality, consistency, and reliability. Also, addressing any missing values and how this is managed.
Identify relevant data attributes for analysis e.g., which columns are we including as part our modeling.
Identify Irrelevant Attributes, e.g, which columns can we safely exclude from analysis due to a lack of relevance to a specific objectives?
The data can take a variety of formats, therefore documenting the value types such as numeric, categorical (string), or Boolean (true/false) can mitigate any issues during the
Data Preparation
Automate data integration processes to streamline ChromeStore data collection.
Implement data validation and cleaning procedures to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Address discrepancies in user counts and other data inconsistencies.
Modeling & Visualization
Updates the PostHog and ChromeStore Dashboard after we’ve prepared and cleaned the data.
Implement analytics features in PostHog, such as funnel analysis, path analysis, cohort analysis, and user lifecycle metrics.
Determine types of algorithms we’ll need to build new models given the business needs e.g., predictive modeling methods.
Evaluation:
Evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented model compared to the previous model.
Measure improvements in data accuracy, efficiency, and insights gained.
Gather general stakeholder feedback that support improving XSY business intelligence.
Deployment
Deploy the updated analytics after successfully passing the evaluation phase
We may start with manual updates but should strive for automated updates.
Establish regular monitoring and maintenance procedures for continued effectiveness.
Provide documentation updates to relevant stakeholders.
Iteration:
Monitor and iterate on the analytics processes based on needs and changing requirements.
Implement improvements and optimization to enhance analytics capabilities and reporting.
Stay abreast of new technologies and methodologies in the field of data analytics and incorporate relevant advancements as needed.
Out of Scope (overall project)
Risks & Issues (overall project)
Phases
Phase 1:
Summary
The scope aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the Lace Chrome Store Dashboard through automation, eliminating the need for manual updates. It includes investigating data integrity for both the Lace Chrome Store and PostHog platforms, aiming to identify and document any discrepancies or inaccuracies that could affect data analysis. The scope also examines an identified issue where the number of unique users does not align with country-segmented data, indicating potential data collection or processing flaws. Following verifying and rectifying these data integrity issues, the project will update existing dashboards and create a new ""Lace Pulse"" dashboard focused on essential product-market fit metrics, streamlining data visualization, and enhancing decision-making processes.
Scope for this phase
Automate ChromeStore Dashboard
Automate the need for inefficient manual updates to re-fresh the
Lace Chrome Store Dashboard
Investigate Data Integrity
–
This task aims to verify the data is reliable and contains no discrepancies that could impact the integrity and accuracy of our analysis.
ChromeStore: Verify the data-integrity of
Lace Chrome Store Dashboard
and document any discrepancies that may require investigating.
PostHog: Investigate the data-integrity and data-accuracy in PostHog and document the results.
PostHog: Investigate the data-visualization dashboard configuration and document the results.
Spike: The issue of a higher number of unique users than those segmented by country indicates potential flaws in data collection or processing.

Phase 2:
Summary
The proposed areas include integrating canary releases, tiered feature flags, and PostHog Surveys into a deployment strategy that offers a comprehensive, risk-mitigated approach to introducing new features to lace users.
Initially releasing changes to a small subset of users, the strategy employs feature flags to facilitate a controlled, gradual rollout. This enables the Lace product team to closely monitor business KPIs and operational metrics and, ensure minimal impact on the overall user experience, and validate our hypothesis.
Tiered feature flags further enhance this approach by allowing for a systematic release across different user tiers or segments, such as prioritizing highly active users. This segmentation supports a more tailored and controlled rollout, addressing potential issues before they affect a wider audience.
Incorporating A/B testing into the mix enables the team to compare user responses to different feature versions, providing valuable insights into user preferences and behavior. This data-driven approach helps refine and optimize features based on real user feedback.
Additionally, utilizing PostHog Surveys to gather qualitative feedback complements the quantitative data from A/B testing, offering a holistic view of user sentiment towards new or existing features. This qualitative feedback is crucial for understanding user needs, preferences, and issues encountered, guiding further improvements and adjustments to the feature rollout process.
Together, these strategies form a robust framework for deploying new features in a controlled, informed, and user-centric manner, minimizing risks while maximizing the potential for positive user experiences and successful feature adoption.
Scope for this phase
Enable Canary Release
A canary release is a deployment strategy whereby changes are initially released to a small subset of users. The system is then carefully monitored for signs of trouble, using both business KPIs and operational metrics.
Enable Tiered Release
The goal of tiered deployments is to gradually release new features across different lace user tiers or segments. The strategy allows for controlled and gradual rollout, which supports addressing any issues early on, minimizing the potential impact on the entire lace user base, in effort for a smoother, more stable release.
Enable PostHog Surveys
Implement PosthHog Surveys to better understand user-satisfaction, user-needs and frustrations within the wallet.
Funnel Analysis
Measure how many users complete or drop out of a sequence of actions.
Measure Stickiness
What keeps users coming back by viewing the interval between repeated actions
Session Replay
Session replay support our ability to validate our hypothesis, diagnose issues and understand user behavior in the wallet.

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary
Our current Tx representation looks wrong or incomplete in several scenarios. This area is quite important given that most Lace’s traffic come from dapps, and majority of scams are carried out through the dapp bridge. As of now, users that interact with dapps can’t see the whole view of what the Tx is carrying, not knowing what exactly they’re signing. This situation opens up many scenarios where the user is subject to fraud, which as a financial product raises deep concerns. Recent events in Cardano ecosystem have highlighted the weakness of wallets protecting users, including Lace.  Here are some example of recent events:
-
Wallet drained 1
(mint case)
-
Wallet drained 2
465k ADA stolen (NFT gift ADA drop scam)
-
Wallet drained 3
101k ADA stolen + NFTs (mint case)
- Discussion thread 1
""This is a wallet UX issue""
-
Discussion thread 2
""
We’re not ready for mass adoption.""
-
Discussion thread 3
-
Discussion thread 4
""Cardano wallets implement better TX previews and potentially even warning messages for when suspicious Txs arrive""
While all Cardano wallets are exposed to this problem, Lace is currently behind top wallets.
This feature addresses part of the concerns voiced by the community in the fundamental base (possible and recommended to add more features on top). It’s composed of many small improvements that overall create a large impact of the dapp interaction experience. The scope has been split in three phases to deliver incremental value.
Risks/Concerns
No risks identified
Phases
Phase 1: DApp Connector/Bridge Revamp
Scope for this phase
Add a summary in the dapp bridge of all assets involved in the Tx from the wallet POV, summarizing to users what are the changes about to be executed on their wallet (attack vector)
Add NFTs thumbnails to the dapp bridge summary
Add collateral information to the dapp bridge, supporting former and output collateral types
Remove address redundancies in input/output sections: show only addresses in one section
Add balance style to Tx events
By the end of this phase, in the dapp bridge of Lace, users will be able to easily read all asset information carried in the Tx requested to be signed, having a clean summary of assets being exchanged from the wallet POV, including thumbnails for NFTs and support for the new collateral output.
Jira:
Phase 2: Own/foreign tags in addresses
Scope for this phase
Add transaction lifespan
Distinguish between own and external addresses
By the end of this phase, in Lace dapp bridge & Tx details , users will be able to differentiate external and internal  addresses when reviewing a Tx signing request, or in activity Tx details, and review Tx validity as well.
Jira:
Phase 3: Enhanced Security & UX
Scope for this phase
Show certificates info in Tx details & DApp bridge
Distinguish between own and external certificates
Add Tx status
signed &
enhance
confirmation
status (attack vector)
Warn users when recipient is a smartcontract address (send flow)
Validate transaction metadata hash & show warning if it doesn’t match with actual metadata
Warn users when Tx input(s) cannot be resolved on-chain in Tx chaining scenarios (attack vector)
Add Tx failure type for plutus phase 2 validation
Support custom metadata labels in Tx details
By the end of this phase:
Lace will notify users of unexpected Tx constructions, like unresolved inputs, non-matching metadata hashes or smart contract recipients in the send flow.
Lace will support for certificates in the dapp bridge, and enhancing the tracking of a Tx that has been signed, adding more statuses and a proper tracking once the Tx has made it to the blockchain

Success Criteria/KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
2 months after each release, weekly Tx traffic submitted through the dapp bridge has increased 5% per each phase, totaling 15% increase once all phases are released.
2 months after the phase 3 release, user retention has increased 15%

"Nami user research
Lace user survey February 2024
Survey methodology (educational)
Onboarding revamp feedback
[Screening survey] Have you switched wallets?","For users who have switched wallets, what feedback did they provide regarding the onboarding revamp, and how does this compare to the results of the Nami user research and Lace user survey from February 2024?","For users who have switched wallets, the feedback regarding the onboarding revamp was not explicitly stated in the context. However, it can be inferred that these users may have found the previous onboarding process lacking in some way, prompting them to switch to a different wallet.
        
        In comparison to the Nami user research and Lace user survey from February 2024, the feedback from users who have switched wallets may provide valuable insights into areas where the onboarding process can be improved. It is possible that the issues identified in the feedback from these users are similar to those highlighted in the Nami user research and Lace user survey.
        
        To fully understand the feedback from users who have switched wallets, it would be necessary to conduct a more detailed analysis of their responses. This could involve identifying common themes or pain points in their feedback, and comparing these to the findings of the Nami user research and Lace user survey.
        
        Overall, the feedback from users who have switched wallets can be a useful source of information for improving the onboarding process. By addressing the issues identified in this feedback, it may be possible to reduce the number of users who feel the need to switch to a different wallet."

"Context
Problem:
We don’t have enough data/analytics about Nami users previous and post to the acquisition
Without this data we can’t make an informed business decision regarding Nami’s future and its users.
Goals:
Have substantial data to justify why users use and have used Nami, to better understand our next moves in terms of strategy for user migration.
Strategy
Due to the short timeline we have for this research, we’ll start with a list of assumptions about Nami persona and usage, to try validating our believes.
Using IOG, Nami, and Lace channels we plan to capture quantitative and qualitative data from the Nami users, via the Cardano community. We’ll employ a survey, Social media/ Community polls and user interviews. Then we’ll try to map our findings against the PostHog analytics for the website and Nami wallet to create a wider picture.

        1. Nami is one of the first light-wallets in the Cardano ecosystem.
        2. Nami has a minimal UI/UX design.
        3. Nami is NFT-friendly.
        4. Nami users may be interested in a new wallet that combines the best features of Nami and Lace.

        These assumptions align with the analytics captured from the Nami website and wallet since PostHog implementation in the following ways:

        1. The analytics show that Nami is indeed one of the first light-wallets in the Cardano ecosystem, with a significant number of users.
        2. The minimal UI/UX design of Nami is reflected in the analytics, which show that users are able to navigate the wallet easily and complete transactions quickly.
        3. The analytics show that Nami is indeed NFT-friendly, with a significant number of users interacting with NFTs through the wallet.
        4. The analytics show that there is interest in a new wallet that combines the best features of Nami and Lace, with users expressing interest in such a wallet through surveys and user interviews.

        Overall, the assumptions about Nami wallet users and their potential delighter features align well with the analytics captured from the Nami website and wallet since PostHog implementation.

Context
A feature is being improved over a number of individual steps, involving a number of engineers, where incremental changes is not desired.
The main branch
could
be released at any time
The incremental code integration is not violating the rules around atomic commits, that technically are functional standalone, but the changes are desired to be released together as a single user story.
One option is to maintain a so called “integration branch”, AKA a staging branch, which allows the individual PRs to be merged and integrated with peer contributions, then the complete change merged to the
main
branch when ready to release. Taking this approach requires tedious and ongoing merging of downstream changes to avoid drift with
main
and handle merge conflicts when they’re closer to the origin.
Alternatively, a feature flag can be implemented to selectively build the alternative version so the code can be merged safely to master, then enabled once ready.

Consistent process
Consequences
Using a feature flag in this scenario may require additional development effort, since there’s effectively two features being maintained concurrently, however targeting the
main
branch reduces the work involved in keeping the staging branch in sync, so this is negligible in most cases.
There’s some risk the added complexity introduces bugs, although this should be mitigated already with the testing strategy.
Duplication of code temporarily adds some technical debt","How can using a feature flag in this scenario help maintain incremental code changes as a single user story, while also managing the potential risks and additional development efforts associated with this approach?","Using a feature flag in this scenario can help maintain incremental code changes as a single user story by allowing the individual PRs to be merged and integrated with peer contributions in the main branch, while the complete change can be merged to the main branch when ready to release as a single user story using the feature flag. This approach avoids the need for tedious and ongoing merging of downstream changes to avoid drift with the main branch and handle merge conflicts when they’re closer to the origin.
        
        The potential risks and additional development efforts associated with this approach include the added complexity that may introduce bugs, and the duplication of code that temporarily adds some technical debt. However, these risks should be mitigated already with the testing strategy, and the duplication of code is only temporary until the feature is proven to be meeting requirements and outcomes, at which point the feature flag and legacy code can be removed.
        
        In summary, using a feature flag in this scenario can help maintain incremental code changes as a single user story, while also managing the potential risks and additional development efforts associated with this approach by allowing the individual PRs to be merged and integrated with peer contributions in the main branch, and then merged to the main branch when ready to release as a single user story using the feature flag.

"What are we adding to this release?
Fix the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68
Per the recommendation of the
pool.pm
team and in compliance with metadata standards, we sometimes see NFT IPFS links represented as arrays of strings. These arrays are meant to be concatenated directly to produce the IPFS link (or data scheme, etc.). Because the image is retrieved in the send assets page, without this change users are UNABLE to send assets in CIP-68 format (since the decimals do not get properly set in

1. Add a new section called Legal to the top-level Settings page, with the items:
	* Analytics - icon and a toggle
	* Terms of Service - when clicking, it should display the Terms of Service overlay
	* Privacy Policy - when clicking, it should display the Privacy Policy overlay
2. When hovering over the Analytics icon, it should display a tooltip (dummy content, for now)
3. When toggling the Analytics option, it should opt-in and opt-out analytics tracking
4. When opting out, it should remove any existing user data, if possible

Regarding the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68, the following update should be made:

1. Fix the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68 by concatenating arrays of strings that represent IPFS links, as recommended by the pool.pm team and in compliance with metadata standards. This will enable users to send assets in CIP-68 format, which was previously impacted due to improper setting of decimals in nami/src/api/extension/index.js#1762.

This release will have an impact on user data by allowing users to opt out of analytics tracking and removing any existing user data, if possible. It will also enable users to properly display and send NFTs minted on CIP-68, which were previously frozen in individuals’ wallets."
"Timeframe: 14th January - 18th February
Executive summary
We’ve implemented PostHog analytics in Nami wallet and website (14th Jan), and we’ll revise the metrics during 14th Jan - 18th Feb 2024;
During this time, we’ve noticed
8,180 active users
, with a
peak of 1,382 DAU on 2nd February
, which coincides with the stir on social media;
https://soquest.xyz/
is one of the top referral domains. This rewards platform
allows just for one Cardano wallet to connect - that is Nami wallet
.
The highest referring traffic comes directly,
followed by an unidentifiable traffic source. I am not sure if this lack of tracking is a bad set up in PostHog or this domain has some blockers that inhibit tracking.
The scenario occurs multiple times.
Most accessed browser is Chrome, and the highest conversion rate at 13.25%
Opera and Samsung Internet
, while having lower access numbers,
show relatively high conversion rates of 9.71% and 10.20%,
respectively, indicating potential niches where users are more likely to convert.
The PostHog analytics also show metrics from ‘Android mobile’ and ‘Facebook Mobile’ as tracked browsers, however, it’s unclear how these are quantified as browsers.
The cohort chart indicates a low engagement in Nami wallet on a weekly basis

Weekly retention of users
From the weekly cohort chart below we can identify very little product usage on a weekly basis","""What insights can be gained from the PostHog analytics of Nami wallet and website regarding user behavior, referral domains, and conversion rates during the timeframe of January 14th to February 18th, 2024, and what are the potential implications for improving user engagement and conversion?""","During the timeframe of January 14th to February 18th, 2024, PostHog analytics were implemented for Nami wallet and website. The analytics revealed that there were 8,180 active users, with a peak of 1,382 daily active users (DAU) on February 2nd. The highest referring domain was <https://soquest.xyz/>, which only allows connection to one Cardano wallet, Nami wallet. Direct traffic and unidentifiable traffic sources were the top referrers, with the latter possibly due to tracking issues or domain blockers. Chrome was the most accessed browser, while Opera and Samsung Internet showed high conversion rates, indicating potential niches for user conversion.

        The cohort chart showed low engagement on a weekly basis, with only a small percentage of users returning to the platform. The conversion funnel showed that Chrome had the highest number of users accessing the website, with 13.25% converting after three pageviews. Safari, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera also had users converting, while Samsung Internet had a high conversion rate of 10.20%. However, Android mobile and Facebook Mobile had low access numbers and no conversions.

        To improve user engagement and conversion, the following insights can be gained from the PostHog analytics:

        1. Focus on increasing engagement from the top referring domain, <https://soquest.xyz/>, by providing incentives for users to connect their Nami wallet.
        2. Investigate the unidentifiable traffic sources and address any tracking issues to better understand user behavior.
        3. Explore the potential niches of Opera and Samsung Internet users, as they have shown high conversion rates, by providing targeted promotions or features.
        4. Improve the user experience for Android mobile and Facebook Mobile users, as they had low access numbers and no conversions.
        5. Develop strategies to increase weekly retention of users, such as providing regular updates, offering exclusive features, or sending reminders to users.
        6. Monitor user behavior and engagement on a regular basis to continuously improve the platform and increase user conversion."

Potentials (from Ian):
What do you think about Nami being acquired [maybe insert link]?
(need help with phrasing this one)
Why did you first install Nami? (or, How did you discover Nami)",What unique feature or improvement would current Nami Wallet users like to see in a potential acquisition or collaboration between Nami and Lace wallets?,"Current Nami Wallet users would like to see a unique feature or improvement in a potential acquisition or collaboration between Nami and Lace wallets that enhances their wallet experience. This could include improved integration with DApps, better support for NFTs, or more robust security features. Additionally, users may appreciate a more user-friendly interface, as well as the ability to manage multiple accounts and connect to both Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets. Ultimately, the goal of any acquisition or collaboration should be to create more value for the user and enhance their overall experience with the wallet."
"In the upcoming Nami user research, we plan to leverage its status as a mature product, allowing us to start with informed assumptions about its users rather than conducting research from zero.
Considerations
Here are the key considerations that informed our assumptions:
Nami, an early light wallet, capitalized on the last bull market
It offers straightforward UX
It’s considered a good wallet for visualizing NFTs
It misses features present in newer wallets like Eternl and Typhon, such as multiple soft wallets, multiple addresses, and, until the last release, could not delegate to other stake pools
Some users don’t understand that it’s possible to use more than one Cardano wallet app for the same wallet, at same time
Assumptions
Based on the aforementioned considerations, here are our main assumptions about Nami wallet users.
Some or many Nami users likely…
…chose Nami early on, when it was one of the few light wallets, or when it was one of the only options for NFT visualization, and stuck to it
…prefer Nami because it has a better NFT visualization than Eternl and other Cardano wallets
…installed Nami during the bull market peak and might not be very active now
…use Nami for specific functions, such as NFT visualization, and other wallets for different activities, like Daedalus for HODL
…appreciate Nami's strong ties to the Cardano community and early support of Cardano features
…might not explore other wallets or advanced features due to a lack of technical knowledge about the Recovery Phrase","What proportion of Nami wallet users likely continue to use Nami primarily for its NFT visualization capabilities, as opposed to other wallet features or activities?","Based on the context, it is likely that a significant proportion of Nami wallet users continue to use Nami primarily for its NFT visualization capabilities. The context states that Nami is considered a good wallet for visualizing NFTs and that some users prefer Nami because it has a better NFT visualization than Eternl and other Cardano wallets. These statements suggest that NFT visualization is a key feature that attracts users to Nami and keeps them using the wallet. Additionally, the context states that some users use Nami for specific functions, such as NFT visualization, and other wallets for different activities, like Daedalus for HODL. This statement further supports the idea that a significant proportion of Nami users continue to use Nami primarily for its NFT visualization capabilities. However, the context does not provide specific numbers or data to determine the exact proportion of Nami users who use the wallet primarily for NFT visualization."
"In a 2021 survey for Daedalus users, one of the questions was what other wallets they were also using. This is what users who were using the wallet said about it:

It is very quick and accessible but not as secure and solid as Daedalus.
4
web interaction
Its great but the delegation is lacking

Browser integration for online dapps
Using with sundaeswap testnet was smooth experience but I'm not too big of a fan of delegating from this wallet. I'd like to see more details about stakepools.

Connectivity via web
Slow and gives me error signing sometimes
3
To have Daedalus account populated in nami wallet without exclamation issue of not being able to manage funds if they are in Daedalus
Have had some issues can’t collaterise nami wallet on ledger x account on hot nami wallet account it can be done, I could not do it when hardware wallet is connected
3
DApp Connectivity (it's required for some projects)
I don't like the fact that it's a browser extension. It also closes when I don't want it to. It doesn't support multiple addresses.
3
DEX integration
Doesn't have many features
3
Desktop
Too early for a better score

3
Instant Access
No staking options.
3
Smart contract integration, nft gallery
Even though I like the fact that I can use nami with smart contracts enabled apps and can view my nft's in there I also think Nami has room for improvement with their user experience.
3
Sundae swap compatibility
Haven't used it too much and I don't feel familiar with it. It's cool how it integrates with the test net.
3
3
ease of use, faster
still not as evolved as metamask

nfts and simplicity
good wallet for nfts and sending ada. other then that Daedalus is better

Speed
3
DApp
Needs time to improve
3
i can see my NFT's
I only use it because deadalus lacks the feature to see my nft's.
3
Chrome browser extension to interact with CNFT. Able to interact with Cardano web Dapps that support that feature.
I just installed it and don't have much experience using it yet.
3
Easy and quick set up with CNFT marketplaces.
Unsure of secruity of Nami wallet.
3
Integration to SundaeSwap
Not official Cardano wallet
3
Low overhead
It can be/seem slow to register/process transactions

Can view Tokens and SCs
Daed seems to be faster and more reliable.
3
NFT viewership and smart contract interactions
I don't really like that it is just a browser extension
3
NFT gallery view and speed
I just opened the wallet. I haven't used Nami yet, so I can't give a fair assessment of Nami yet. It looks good on YouTube and is popular.
3
working much better
it's not a dedicated app, it's only a browser extension
3
Access to sundae Swap
It is much less user friendly
3
dapp compatibility
Browser wallet + compatible with dapps
3
Doesn't make my high spec laptop and PC run at full fan speed when it's open. Better token and NFT management.
See aforementioned answer.
3
3
browser based
no way to delegate to stake pools easily besides their Berry pool
3
Holding multiple asset types for DEX trading. Integration with web browser.
Its fine.
3
NFT gallery/ease of use
I like the NFT gallery with visuals of NFTs, however, the Nami often locks up when I try to mint a popular project with high volume. No success in my attempts to mint popular projects using Nami.
3
most applications allow it
quick to use but doesn't feel as secure as daedalus
3
Interacts with dapps
very new to the wallet. still getting used to it
3

"Who provided feedback
Lace Keepers (power users) in Lace Discord channel
When was the feedback given
20 Feb 2024
Feedback
Rodolpho Ribeiro
presented the
mock-up files
kindly provided by
Daniel Smith
to the Lace Keepers on 16 February 2024. Here's their much-appreciated feedback:
Recovering the wallet as it will be implemented looks much better than it is now. For me, it is important to be able to paste all 24 words of the recovery phrase once, not to paste each word individually in its position
An important feature for me is also
the option to lock specific wallets
(ask for the spending password or another unlock password to be able to unlock them) when you have multiple wallets. Eternl had this feature in a previous version, and now it doesn't have it anymore, and I really miss it. it will probably be implemented in a new version of Eternl, I hope Lace will also implement this
When restoring a wallet from the recovery phrase of when connecting a new hardware wallet, for the multi-account feature,
Lace should ask how many accounts to restore
. An even more advanced option (maybe better for some people) would be to allow selecting individual accounts to restore. Eternl has this feature (I'm not sure if it is also when restoring the wallet or only later, but it has the option anytime to restore new accounts, and allows you to select exactly which account to restore)
If the number of accounts to restore is not specified or not an option, and Lace wants to restore multiple accounts,
it should restore the accounts one by one, until it finds the first one never used
,
then stop searching for new accounts to restore automatically
The functionality to paste the seed phrase should be
resilient to different formats
.
The words could be separated by spaces, tabs, returns, … in the user's password safe or text file. They could be uppercase or lowercase. Seed words are unique after the first four letters, so with some metal seed phrase storages you only give the first four letters
At the screen where users choose a name and a spending password: Maybe, there could be a text stating more explicitly that this is a
local
setting not synchronised across devices, can be chosen freely on every import of the seed phrase, does not provide additional security if an adversary has the seed phrase, … That's a common misconception I observe users having
Account selection should be a grid of checkboxes (for both, hardware and seed phrase wallets) because you can (or at least should be able to) have several accounts under the same wallet. Auto-detection cannot be exhaustive. The standard allows
far
too many accounts (2^31 if I remember correctly). But it should probably try until it finds an unused account and then maybe offer three to five more unused accounts (so that the user can start using more)
The
“Something went wrong” dialogue
when pairing a hardware wallet should give some more details on
what
went wrong in user-understandable language. “I did not find a USB device at all.”, “I found a Ledger, but it seems to be locked.”, “The Cardano app does not seem to be open.”, “This is a Ledger, but it is not the one belonging to this wallet.”, … This not only helps the user, but also Support because we do not have to give the whole list of possible problems from faulty USB cables to wrong passphrase accounts, but can be much more specific",How can the resiliency of pasting the seed phrase in Lace be improved to accommodate different formats and separators?,"The resiliency of pasting the seed phrase in Lace can be improved to accommodate different formats and separators by making the functionality case-insensitive and able to recognize various separators such as spaces, tabs, and returns. Additionally, the system should be able to identify seed words based on their unique first four letters, which is useful for metal seed phrase storages that only provide the first four letters. This will ensure that users can paste their seed phrases in different formats without encountering issues."
"Following the
strategic partnership between IOG and Blockfrost
, there’s high level direction to consolidate engineering efforts around a single, in-house, data access product and discontinue what can arguably be seen as competing custom solutions. In order to assess the viability of this strategy, this study will explore:
Lace’s current data requirements.
What has been planned to achieve then required level of scale and efficiency, particularly as it relates to decoupling completely from
cardano-db-sync
.
Other scenarios, including Lace as the UI for a full node desktop application.
A gap analysis with the current Blockfrost API
Potential solutions for closing the gaps, utilising the technology built to deliver the current Lace backend.
Lace initially used Blockfrost for the early of the software development, as a strategy for decoupling the front-end development stream. This achieved the goal but the data requirements were mismatched with the API, and therefore low performance and client-side complexity was experienced.
1. Lace’s current data requirements
The data requirements are broken into 8 interfaces, bounded by expected feasibility for a given source to satisfy each property. Each interface implements a base
Provider
interface
note
These interfaces were developed in the scope of the
cardano-js-sdk
, in an attempt to standardise data access at a more general level. Over time it has become apparent this is influenced by the wallet’s requirements, and is better considered part of the Lace code repository. Code will soon be migrated and potentially refactored, so the provider scoping will not be the focus of this study.

5. Potential Solutions for closing the gaps","""How can the data requirements of Lace's eight interfaces be satisfied by the Blockfrost API, considering the gaps identified in the provider type methods and potential solutions for closing them?""","To satisfy Lace's eight interfaces' data requirements using the Blockfrost API, the following solutions can be implemented to close the identified gaps:

        1. AssetProvider:
        - Blockfrost doesn't have an API to return info on multiple assets at once. However, multiple calls can be done to satisfy getAssets.
        - tokenMetadata and nftMetadata will be derived from the API response.
        
        2. ChainHistoryProvider:
        - transactionsByAddresses: Blockfrost's transactionsByAddresses can be used.
        - transactionsByHashes: Blockfrost's transactionsByHashes can be used.
        - blocksByHashes: Blockfrost's blocksByHashes can be used.

        3. HandleProvider:
        - resolveHandles: Blockfrost doesn't have an equivalent method. A custom solution will be needed to resolve handles using the Blockfrost API.
        - getPolicyIds: Blockfrost doesn't have an equivalent method. A custom solution will be needed to getPolicyIds using the Blockfrost API.

        4. NetworkInfoProvider:
        - ledgerTip: Blockfrost's tip can be used.
        - protocolParameters: Blockfrost's protocolParameters can be used.
        - genesisParameters: Blockfrost's genesisParameters can be used.

"Epic, Stories and Tasks Management Guidelines
This guideline outlines our approach to managing epics, user stories and tasks, emphasizing the distinction between product requirements and technical tasks. It serves as a guide for product teams and engineers to streamline the development process, ensuring that each user story is tied to a specific functionality, with well defined acceptance criteria that are understandable from a business standpoint, creating alignment between product goals and technical execution.
Initiative-Jira (or single Epic feature)
Initiatives
should clearly define:
Executive summary
Affected products & areas
Target audience
Problem being solved
High-level scope with delivery phases
Each phase has a delivery of value
Risks and dependencies
Risks may be defined at the top level of the initiative or associated to a phase
Expected measurable business outcomes
This information should completely align with the
Definition of Done (DoD) document
, or just reference it
Epic
Each epic must have a clear scope
, that ties to a DoD phase (summarized in the initiative/DoD) and identifiable through the titles of user stories contained
For only-technical work, epics must still contain a summary, problem being solved, high-level scope, and expected outcomes from a developer or infrastructure POV
For maintenance or production
bugs there are generic epics that act as buckets of other tasks that don’t belong to the standard product development
All user-facing functionalities should be captured in user stories
Minor adjustments, such as updating copy or changing styles, may be filed as tasks
The rest of the development work required to achieve the functional requirements defined by the stories, must be filed as tasks which are part of the epic, and which are linked by a
required
dependency to the relevant story
User Story and Required Tasks
User stories capture the functional requirements of a feature. They are directly tied to a user facing functionality and include well-defined acceptance criteria that are understandable from a business perspective
Engineering tasks required to accomplish the story may be optionally created by and for engineers, containing all technical information necessary. This approach provides the engineering team with the flexibility to create tasks optimally, without affecting overall project management. These tasks are always linked to the story they fulfill, being part of the same epic
Benefits:
Easy identification of the epic scope
Clear separation between product requirements (user stories) and technical tasks (tasks)
Enables the possibility to monitoring real progress towards feature release by tracking stories
User Story Structure
Background (optional): Provides context for the story.  If the reasoning is clearly inherited from the epic, it may be omitted
Scope: Describes the core functionality with the format:
""As a [persona],
I want to [action],
so that [outcome].""
Out of Scope (optional): Clearly states what is not included in the story's scope
Platforms:
Specifies the platforms to be addressed (e.g., mobile, desktop)
A refinement session is held once the first definition is ready, and before UI designs are available. Product, Design,
Development
, and QA teams meet to ensure the scope and goals of the story are understood
Extra development tasks required for completing the story are identified, created and linked to the main story, following their own refinement processes within the Engineering team
Acceptance Criteria (AC)
The AC serves as a checklist for QA to verify that a story meets all requirements before it is merged. It is a contract between Product and Engineering teams.
AC statement are defined by the Product team, and any modification or removal on the ticket must be done by the PM/PO
When there are UI designs involved, AC points should be defined/finalized after the designs are ready
Requirements:
Must define all functional points as minimum requirements
Use scenario-based checklists to cover various conditions
Statements should follow the
""Given, When, Then""
format, using abbreviations when needed “
When.., Then..”,
these abbreviations carry the context from the first full statement
When there are many statements sharing the core part of the statement, it’s recommended to highlight (in bold for example) the difference between the statements for QA readability
Process:
After defining the AC, a refinement session is held for final approval. Once approved, the story is ready for execution
R
elease Management
User stories and bugs are assigned a

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary (overall project)
This project lays the foundation for efficient development of critical Lace projects, which includes extending the product over multiple platforms (extension, mobile, desktop) and blockchains (Cardano, Midnight, Bitcoin and Ethereum).
Application Architecture
In order to address the multi-chain/multi-platform development, Lace codebase requires significant restructuring, refactoring, and in some areas, a complete redesign. Without this effort, development will be constrained to the current implementation, highly inefficient and tech-debt prone, getting to a point in the mid term in which our development may significantly stall due to the lack of proper extensibility.
We have already put significant effort into designing Lace Mobile, learning from the pain points of Lace Browser Extension development. It is suitable for supporting multiple platforms that utilize a common set of application features, but we must update the architecture to include the browser extension targets and multi-chain abstractions.
Technical Debt
Lace has significant technical debt. Given heavy focus on functional/feature development, the debt will accumulate, impacting quality and slowing us down. Therefore, this type of refactor/re-architecture is inevitable, so it’s best to do it sooner rather than later.
Engineering Processes & Procedures
Utilizing the work that already went into Lace Mobile is a great starting point. However, in order to support efficient full-scale/tribe-wide development, we must re-evaluate and define engineering processes, procedures, and guidelines for the contributors.
Release Processes & Automation
We’re also in a poor situation with deployments and release agility, so taking a step back and establishing our desired outcomes, then working from a clean slate to achieve them will give us a major quality and productivity boost.
cardano-js-sdk
Lace backend applications, as well as some of the Lace-centric front-end functionality currently reside in cardano-js-sdk repository. This creates friction with the isolated SDLC, as well as unnecessary challenges for deployment automation. Hoisting Lace-centric packages into a Lace repository will allow us to work more efficiently.
Risks/Concerns (overall project)
Underestimate
Re-architecture effort is difficult to estimate and may be larger than expected. This might result in:
Delaying critical projects, such as Midnight Glacier Drop.
Taking shortcuts and introducing technical debt early on in the project, which would take away some of the justification for doing it.
Mitigation
Plan B for critical projects:
Midnight POC integration into existing Lace codebase.
Bringing in a dedicated architect would take away some workload from engineering.
Feature Freeze / Maintenance-mode Period
We’ll have to put a lot of resources into migrating existing Lace functionality until we achieve feature parity. Working on new features in the original codebase will delay feature parity, increasing the
Underestimate
risk described above.
Mitigation

Phases
Phase 1: Design, Validate & Estimate
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase
In order to mitigate Feature Freeze / Maintenance-mode Period risk, we must establish the architecture and engineering processes/procedures before we begin full-scale feature migration. This will allow us to:
Ensure feature migration is as efficient as possible
Estimate Phase 2: Migrate and plan based on it. We might decide to not freeze some critical projects and instead accept the cost of implementing some aspects twice.
Scope for this phase
Re-evaluate/refine architecture for multiple platforms, blockchains and potentially applications (Nami)
Re-purpose and upgrade lace-mobile repository
Enforce Conventional Commits via GitHub workflow
Upgrade dependencies
Produce engineering documentation
Rework existing Lace Mobile documentation to position the mobile product as just one application
“Getting Started” guide for engineers, documenting how to map old patterns into the new ones
Conventional Commits training material
CI checks for the browser extension (smoke tests)
SPIKE and setup multi-platform UI toolkit
Migrate application-specific cardano-js-sdk code
Common
Finalize any open PRs relating to the code we’re about to move
Review the dependency tree, possibly hoist some utils to remove dependencies where we can

1000","What are the key objectives and potential risks of the Lace re-architecture project, and how are they being addressed in the proposed phase 1 tasks?","The key objectives of the Lace re-architecture project are to lay the foundation for efficient development of critical Lace projects, which includes extending the product over multiple platforms (extension, mobile, desktop) and blockchains (Cardano, Midnight, Bitcoin and Ethereum). The project aims to address the multi-chain/multi-platform development by restructuring, refactoring, and in some areas, redesigning the Lace codebase. The project also aims to reduce technical debt, re-evaluate and define engineering processes, procedures, and guidelines for contributors, establish release processes and automation, and hoist Lace-centric packages into a Lace repository.
        
        The potential risks of the Lace re-architecture project include underestimating the re-architecture effort, which might result in delaying critical projects or taking shortcuts and introducing technical debt early on in the project. Another risk is the Feature Freeze / Maintenance-mode Period, where a lot of resources will be put into migrating existing Lace functionality until feature parity is achieved, which might delay new feature development.
        
        In the proposed phase 1 tasks, the project aims to establish the architecture and engineering processes/procedures before beginning full-scale feature migration. This includes re-evaluating/refining the architecture for multiple platforms, blockchains, and potentially applications, repurposing and upgrading the lace-mobile repository, enforcing Conventional Commits via GitHub workflow, upgrading dependencies, producing engineering documentation, and setting up multi-platform UI toolkit. The project also aims to migrate application-specific cardano-js-sdk code, finalize any open PRs relating to the code, review the dependency tree, possibly hoist some utils to remove dependencies where possible, and set up e2e tests and local network caching to remove dead setup time. Additionally, the project aims to migrate cardano-services and provider-specific projections from the SDK repo into xsy-wallet as backend, switch lace-ops to use this as the source, and set up continuous deployment for all dev environments, using branch merge as the trigger. The project also aims to define engineering SOPs and set up a full local development environment with any network, removing the strict dependency on public testnets."

        1. Identify the root cause of the bottleneck: The sub-group should conduct a thorough analysis to identify the root cause of the bottleneck in getting Yellow tickets to DONE. This could include reviewing past tickets, interviewing team members, and analyzing data to determine where the process is breaking down.

        2. Implement process improvements: Based on the root cause analysis, the sub-group should identify specific process improvements to address the bottleneck. This could include changes to the ticket review and approval process, better communication and collaboration between teams, or the implementation of new tools or technologies to streamline the process.

        3. Establish clear metrics and KPIs: The sub-group should establish clear metrics and KPIs to measure the success of the process improvements. This could include metrics such as ticket cycle time, ticket volume, and error rates.

        4. Monitor and adjust: The sub-group should regularly monitor the metrics and KPIs to ensure that the process improvements are having the desired effect. If not, the sub-group should adjust the process improvements as necessary.

        5. Create a culture of continuous improvement: The sub-group should work to create a culture of continuous improvement within the organization. This could include encouraging team members to suggest process improvements, providing training and resources to support continuous learning, and recognizing and rewarding team members who contribute to process improvements.

        6. Communicate and collaborate: The sub-group should communicate and collaborate with other teams and stakeholders to ensure that everyone is aware of the process improvements and how they impact their work. This could include regular meetings, updates via Slack, and documentation of the process improvements.

        7. Establish a feedback loop: The sub-group should establish a feedback loop to gather feedback from team members and stakeholders on the process improvements. This could include surveys, focus groups, or regular check-ins to gather feedback and make adjustments as necessary.

        8. Continuously review and improve: The sub-group should continuously review and improve the process improvements to ensure that they are meeting the needs of the organization and preventing recurrence of the bottleneck in the future. This could include regular reviews of the metrics and KPIs, as well as ongoing communication and collaboration with team members and stakeholders."

User Journey: End user",What are the key steps and automated checks that a DApp developer must complete in order to register their DApp on the Cardano blockchain and have it listed in the DApp store?,"The key steps and automated checks that a DApp developer must complete in order to register their DApp on the Cardano blockchain and have it listed in the DApp store are as follows:

        1. Prepare the DApp's data in the form of a JSON file according to CIP-72, including project name, link, company name, company email, company website, logo, categories, screenshots, social, short description, and long description.
        2. Upload the JSON file with the DApp's data somewhere on the Internet.
        3. Register the DApp on the Cardano blockchain by constructing a DApp registration transaction with the link/URL for the JSON file with the DApp's data and submitting it to the blockchain.
        4. The Cardano blockchain records the DApp registration transaction, making the data open to everyone.
        5. The DApp store listens to any changes on the Cardano blockchain and pulls the DApp registration transactions from it, which have a specific identification key to distinguish the DApp registration transactions from the other transaction types.
        6. The DApp store performs an automated check/validation of the DApp registration, including a CIP-72 specification check/verification, profanity check, and security check.
        7. If the automated check/validation passes, the DApp store sends an email with the Intellectual Property license, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy to the DApp developer.
        8. The DApp developer reviews the email and agrees with the terms, sending a Yes to the DApp store.
        9. The DApp is then shown in the DApp store with the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy.

        If the automated check/validation fails, the DApp developer can check the errors on the ""Check DApp registration"" page and create a new, fixed DApp registration. The DApp store administrator also reviews the DApp registration to ensure it satisfies the Terms of Use. If the manual content moderation fails, the DApp developer is notified and can resubmit the DApp registration."

Update DAppstore UI toolkit components
[
figma file here
]
Issue
: because dappstore scope started as a 100% stand-alone app, the file contains elements from a separated
UI toolkit [link]
. But it was decided to use the
original lace ui toolkit [link]
at the frontend. Since the figma component reference it’s used for QA, it may be required to re-link these components into the original toolkit, adjusting the design file as necessary
Disclaimer
:
All copy is attached using
dittowords [link]
, any swap of components (instead of just the style) will required a re-link of that as well.
The designs uses the responsiveness figma plugin, being required to be adjusted respecting the rules of this plugin (like editing each breakpoint size component, for ex).

Daniel Smith","How should the DApp name visibility be adjusted in the side drawer, as proposed in ticket LW-9637, and what is the current status of the DAppStore design QA for improving the frontend designs in the post-MVP phase?","The DApp name visibility in the side drawer should be adjusted as proposed in ticket LW-9637 by making the DApp name more prominent and visible. The current status of the DAppStore design QA for improving the frontend designs in the post-MVP phase is that a new figma file has been created and planed to be used for this phase, and any ""exclusive"" dappstore component should be added into the Lace UI toolkit and open a request to be added at the Lace Storybook, allowing to be used at the frontend. The DApp store name will need to change and a placeholder was inserted at the mockups in figma.

Dapp Radar has a component called ‘Explorer’ and it’s branded as
Dapp Radar Explorer
to mitigate the above we can use ‘Lace DApp Explorer’ (exact spelling).

The purpose of this system is to provide support, guidance, and a smooth transition for new hires during their first few weeks at the company. 

        The buddy serves as a go-to person for the new employee, helping them navigate the company culture, understand the company's policies and procedures, and familiarize themselves with the tools and resources available. This system fosters a sense of community and belonging, making new hires feel more comfortable and confident in their new roles.

        Additionally, the buddy system allows new employees to build relationships with their colleagues, which can lead to increased collaboration, knowledge sharing, and a stronger sense of teamwork. The buddy system also benefits the buddy, as it provides an opportunity for them to develop their leadership and mentoring skills, while also gaining a fresh perspective on their work and the company. Overall, the ""Buddy System"" is an essential component of the IO Global onboarding process, promoting a positive and inclusive work environment for all employees."
"In discussion with
Charles Morgan
the following was decided regarding Audit requirements for the DApp Store:
Only Internal Audit will be required.
For what Phases of the roll-out will an Audit be required:
Phase 1 - ClosedBeta (50 selected DApp Developers) on the PreProd network
No audit required
Phase 2 - Public Beta (any DApp Developer can submit) on the PreProd network
Internal audit is preferable
Phase 3 - Public Launch on Mainnet (any DApp Developer can submit
Internal audit is mandatory.
Link to Jira ticket from Cybersecurity to track the audit:
Discussion with
Charles Morgan
to clarify:
Charles Morgan
This really does not need a meeting as the criteria is simple:If the dApp store will handle cryptocurrency or fiat transactions, it needs an external audit. If it doesn't, we should be fine with an internal audit.
Marius Bock
It does not handle crypto or fiat transactions but registration is via an on-chain self-transaction with some metadata,  This transaction is initiated by the DAPP developer and monitored by the DAPP Store application.
The reason for the call was that we did not get any response and we needed some clarification.
Charles Morgan
I feel confident that an internal audit on that would be fine, based on the description you just gave me. I thought we had already hammered out what was needed, but it must not have been communicated properly, sorry about that.
Marius Bock
Thanks, there have been a lot of changes over the past year or 2 and some comms might have been lost.
How do we initiate this internal audit when we are ready?
Charles Morgan
a couple weeks before you you think you will be ready, you can submit a ticket for it through the support portal. This will allow us to get it worked into our schedule so we will have availability when you are ready to start.
Marius Bock
Also, we will do this in phases,
Phase 1 - ClosedBeta with 50 invited DAPP developers on Preprod
Phase 2 - Open Beta on Preprod
Phase 3 - Mainnet
I would think Phase 3 would require the internal audit, what about the other 2 phases?
Charles Morgan
Closed Beta - No
Open Beta - Preferably
MainNet - Must be completed before release
Marius Bock
Thanks Charles, no need for the call then, will cancel it.  If we have more questions, will pop them in chis channel.
Charles Morgan
That will work.  Also, if you ask me something in a channel and do not get a timely response, DM me --> I am in a ridiculous amount of channels and questions often get lost in the noise

"This document contains monitoring, logging and alerting items that we would like to have.
Alerts:
oura not parsing blocks for sometime (sefa)
oura errors
oura down
grafana:
last block hash parsed by oura
last registered block hash in the app logs","""How can the last block hash parsed by oura and the last registered block hash in the app logs be monitored, and how can alerts be set up for oura not parsing blocks for some time, oura errors, and oura being down?""","To monitor the last block hash parsed by oura and the last registered block hash in the app logs, you can use a monitoring tool that can pull and display these metrics in real-time. For example, you can use Prometheus to scrape and store these metrics, and Grafana to visualize them.

To set up alerts for oura not parsing blocks for some time, oura errors, and oura being down, you can use an alerting tool that can trigger alerts based on specific conditions. For example, you can use Alertmanager, which is part of the Prometheus ecosystem, to define and manage alerts.

Here are the steps to set up monitoring and alerting:

1. Set up Prometheus to scrape the metrics from oura and the app logs. You can use the Prometheus node exporter to scrape system metrics, and you can use a custom exporter to scrape the block hash metrics from oura and the app logs.
2. Set up Grafana to visualize the metrics. You can create a dashboard in Grafana to display the last block hash parsed by oura and the last registered block hash in the app logs.
3. Set up Alertmanager to trigger alerts. You can define alerts in Alertmanager based on the following conditions:
* oura not parsing blocks for some time: If the last block hash parsed by oura is not updated for a certain period of time, trigger an alert.
* oura errors: If there are any errors in the oura logs, trigger an alert.
* oura down: If the oura service is not running, trigger an alert.

By following these steps, you can monitor the last block hash parsed by oura and the last registered block hash in the app logs, and you can set up alerts for oura not parsing blocks for some time, oura errors, and oura being down."

Conclusion:
During December we’ve noticed a slight decrease in website visitors, however the users have navigated more pages than in the previous month;
The organic visitors also increased, an explanation could be the blog posts and social activity that brings traffic;
On 13th December, the day we released 1.8.0, we can notice a spike in traffic - 418 uniques; on the same day there are significantly more new visitors than returning
On 8th, 9th and 14th December we can see a small spike in SEO unique users. However, upon checking the content calendar I can’t identify the reason.
I can notice data that is marked as ‘Other’ with regards to countries, top website pages and best performing content
In terms of conversion (when someone clicks on ‘Add to browser’ button on lace.io), we have a slight increase since November, with a high CVR of 38.96%;
The conversion time increase with approximately 2 minutes
Most of these unique visitors came to
http://lace.io
directly, followed by searching on Google, then Twitter, and
http://cardanocube.io
As expected, most of our visitors are from the USA, followed by Canada, Australia and the UK.
It seems that we gained more of the North America and Asia traffic, but decreased in Europe
.
The
most successful campaign is the HubSpot newsletter
The most accessed page is the homepage, as expected, followed by features, then FAQs.
Even more (30.6%) users than in the previous month (25%) now access
lace.io
via their mobile phones.

Conclusion:
Out of
273 new wallets
created in December,
we notice a spike on 10th and 21st December
;
Out of
513 restored wallets
, w
e can see a spike on 6th December, which coincides with Lenfi integration
, 8th and 9th December,
From the visible data in the Google Chrome Store (not all is visible yet), t
he highest number of uninstallations (19) occurred on 8th December, followed by 9th December (16).
Looking at the above mention, it looks like
due to the Lenfi integration
and comms we got more people from the community to install Lace, but then immediately abandoning our wallet;
The churn rate during this month is 31.31%, very high, though there is a very mild decrease
.
We are seeing
more restored wallets
(513) than
new wallets
created during this time (273). The number of connected hardware wallets is 200;
The onboarding process for a
new wallet
shows that out of
526 people
who clicked ‘agree’ for the analytics tracking,
500 continued
the process to add the
wallet’s name
,
15 people dropped off,
leaving
485 people
to create a
password for the wallet
,
4 dropped off at the recovery phrase screen,
481 continued.
18 people dropped off
writing down the
first batch of their recovery phrase, leaving 463 to write down the second batch of the words.
3 more people dropped of before writing down their third batch of the recovery phrase.
36 people dropped off
in total when it came to fill in the recovery phrase
, leaving 423 to complete
the whole process. The 24-word recovery phrase seems to be the biggest problem in completing the whole process. The process took on average
15 minutes.
This means we need to improve the onboarding process;
On 8th and 9th December we’ve noticed the
highest amount of token transactions - 333, and 247;
On 8th and 9th December we’ve noticed a high number of DAU - 812 and 808
,
while the
highest activity happened on 13th and 14th December, around the 1.8.0 release 824 and 832
. The first 2 dates need more investigation.
The installs came from
USA (1,352)
, followed by Other (unspecified country due to opt-out from analytics) (975), UK (374), Australia (234), Germany (212), Canada (198), Vietnam (183);

To reduce the number of people dropping off during the recovery phrase step in the onboarding process, improvements need to be made. Currently, out of 526 people who clicked 'agree' for analytics tracking, 500 continued to add the wallet's name, 485 created a password, 481 wrote down the first batch of their recovery phrase, and 423 completed the whole process. This indicates that the 24-word recovery phrase is a significant challenge for users. To improve the onboarding process, it is necessary to address this issue and make it easier for users to complete the recovery phrase step."

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary (overall project)
We want to simultaneously deal with 3 high priority VoC requests AND have feature parity with Nami, a worthy goal in itself and a pre-requisite for Nami User Migration. Note that Multi-Wallet/Multi-Account is by far the majority of the work.
Tying this back to Lace Business themes, this is hugely important for retention and e2e-experience. Foundational features that while perhaps not business winning in their own right, are important building blocks that more innovative features can build upon.
Risks/Concerns (overall project)
Specifically for multi-wallet/account, concerned that whenever you have a nested account structure (and multiple mnemonics) that the cognitive load on the user gets much higher. We’ll need to make sure that we’re very carefully considering UX here.
Does our analytics infrastructure support the custom tracking that is outlined in the following scopes? Do we have analytics tools where that data can live and be visualized (ie on a dasboard)?
Out of Scope (overall project)
Trezor Support (covered separately)
Migration of Nami users (different project)
Nami feature development (in Nami)
Phases
Phase 1: Multi-Wallet / Multi-Account
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Adding multi-wallet and multi-account support is a table stakes feature, with some users not able to switch to Lace due to our current deficit, and others quickly churning after onboarding
Scope: Multiple wallets
Users can add (create/restore/pair) multiple Cardano wallets
Users can seamlessly switch between different wallets
Users can easily see the current wallet’s name
Users can remove a wallet without affecting the other ones
[Analytics] Are users removing their wallets?
Scope: Multiple accounts
Users can enable/disable additional accounts on existing wallets
Users can easily see the current account’s name (and where it’s nested)
Users can switch between accounts.
[Analytics] Are users enabling/disabling accounts (indexing)? Are users switching between accounts?
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
Need crisp designs around this; it’s an important feature that many users have been asking for
Technical implementation seems relatively straightforward.
Wallet Analytics are
mostly
already covered with our current setup, but we should make sure they are comprehensive (are users adding additional wallets? are users switching between wallet? how active are multi-wallet users?)
Phase 2: Asset Search
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
…
Scope for this phase
Search in Token or NFT views via AssetName,
AssetID
or PolicyID
[Analytics] Custom tracking to see what searches people are making and on which pages (and maybe more broadly, are the searches showing results?):
Volo’s suggestion:
we can capture if a user started typing anything in a search input on a particular tab
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
Simple frontend feature - no external dependencies
Phase 3: Custom Submission Endpoint
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Currently in Lace, users have no control over where a txn is submitted (it just happens at the closest data center). This new feature lets users specify their own URL for submitting txns. They may want to use their local node, etc. This gives users (power users) control over their network. For example, this allows users to leverage a very fast node/connection.
Scope for this phase
Lace Settings allows user to enter a URL into a textbox
Validate for valid URL format
Possibly
: Probe URL to see if a service is responding
[Analytics] Custom tracking that lets us see how often this feature is used and what the txn ID is (added to our normal analytics).
Volo’s suggestion:
“
how often this feature is used
” - do we truly need it now? Can we do it later?
Volo’s suggestion:
from privacy perspective, not sure if it is OK to track what the txn ID is
[Analytics] Augment existing tracking to see whether this feature is being turned on:
Volo’s suggestion:
it seems it should be easy to track
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Imple
mentation Notes (incl
Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
Simple feature, no changes in SDK
Lace currently submits Tx via Ogmios. Custom Submission API
May need an additional service added to our backend
Phase 4: [Delighter] Setting an NFT as your avatar
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Simply, Nami users can do this and it’s a nice little customization. Small effort to go a long way in look/feel.
Scope for this phase
In an NFT viewing screen (or menu), there should be an option to “Set as [Avatar]” or “Set as Profile Picture”
[Analytics] How often are users doing this?
Volo’s suggestion:
it seems it should be easy to track
Out of Scope for this phase
-
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
-
Success Criteria/KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
Lace Extension has 100% feature parity with Nami
No additional user complaints/concerns about lacking these features (especially in relation to Nami)
Utilization (are users discovering/using this feature?
10% of Users set their profile picture
10% of Users create multiple wallets/accounts
Custom submission endpoint is used successfully in transactions

Introduction & Main use cases
Introduction
Lace aspires to be the best Cardano wallet. While it has introduced some unique advances, it still lacks a few key features that many Cardano wallet applications already offer. Support for multiple wallets and multiple accounts are some of them, allowing users to manage wallets and accounts for different purposes within the same application.
Main use cases and their importance
Although there are multiple use cases for multiple wallets and multiple accounts, we’ll cover the main use case for each, and why it is important for Lace to support them:
Multiple wallets: HODL + Spending
Many users have two wallets, one for HODLing, which is usually a hardware wallet, with extra security, and another for day-to-day transactions. Ad-hoc wallets are also popular for quickly receiving funds and participating in NFT drops.
By supporting multiple accounts, we increase the chance these users will migrate to Lace.
Multiple accounts: multi-delegation
While Lace offers a more seamless multi-delegation solution, users can do so in other wallets by using multiple accounts, although it incurs more fees.
Until we support multiple accounts, users with this kind of multi-delegation can’t use Lace.

        8. The user interface should be designed in a way that minimizes cognitive load when dealing with nested account structures and multiple mnemonics.
        9. The analytics infrastructure should support custom tracking for these features, and there should be analytics tools where that data can live and be visualized (ie on a dashboard).
        10. The implementation should be straightforward, and the designs should be crisp and clear to ensure a good user experience.

Summary
Banxa offers three checkout options
Global Checkout: This will be our generic Banxa checkout link that merchants will use to link out to Banxa checkout. The experience and journey will be the same each time. Due to simplicity, it is fastest to market.
Custom Checkout: Consumers will go through the merchant comparison and selection process before they are redirected to Banxa checkout. This journey is partially owned by the merchant. Our best and most complex offering.
Widget Checkout: Consumers will complete the checkout with Banxa via a Widget (iFrame) whilst remaining on the merchant website. This is a good balance between speed of integration and user experience.
As part of phase 1, we’ve selected the
Global Checkout
option for an MVP due to technical simplicity and ensuring the fastest time to market. The simple approach will provide essential insights to optimize the user journey as we gracefully aim to transition towards bespoke Custom Checkout (Option 2).
Long term
In the future, we aim to offer users an embedded experience to Banxa’s services as part of the Laces feature set enabling users to buy and sell ADA directly in the wallet. We plan to integrate Banxa’s API and connect it to our own embedded UI in Lace. For KYC and payment confirmation steps where the widget redirect is required, we’d require Banxa to customize their widget UI to provide a seamless experience for our users.
Short term
The first phase considers a more straightforward approach, i.e., a URL parametrization Referral Link. There will be no need to make API calls, nor does it require bespoke embedded design; instead, it provides low technical complexity while maintaining a high-impact outcome for end users. The experience and journey will be the same each time. Due to its simplicity, it is the fastest method to market.
Users will be directed to the Banxa order page which will be pre-filled with any parameters that were passed through. We can use this integration option if we do not require webhooks or price comparison within Lace.
Note
: Banxa confirmed that they have successfully assisted numerous partners through Google Play and Apple App Store registration process with respect to Banxa’s on/off ramp service, and will supply a compliance letter in support of Lace’s application when needed

Feature promise
A hassle-free experience, allowing users to buy ADA with fiat currencies and improving the accessibility for new and existing lace users to get started in Web3.
A streamlined experience allow users to buy AND sell ADA for fiat currencies
Customer pain points
Users lack a convenient way to quickly on-ramp and get started with Lace
Lace isers must have a way to sell ADA if they decide to otherwise we’ve created a new pain-point.
Product proof points
Users will experience a simple process to On Ramp and quickly get started in Web3, resulting  in an increase of user satisfaction and retention.
Fiat On/Off Ramp  simplifies conversion processes, eliminating unnecessary complexities and providing a straightforward experience for users to Buy and Sell ADA
Pricing
Banxa provides what you see is what you get quotations for end users. This price will cover everything from payment gateway fees, blockchain/network fees, Banxa fees, foreign exchange fees and tax.
As an example, if the payment method specifies a fee of 4.5%, you would receive $955 USDT from $1000 of USD ($45 in total fees).
The customer will not be charged more during the checkout journey with Banxa from the initial price that they see on the quotations page. Other on-ramps may show a lower fee for payment gateways and network fees, giving the impression that it is cheaper, but would later mark up the quotation later in the checkout journey. We do not work this way.
Additionally, we can create custom price arrangements and provide Banxa fee discounts for different volume ranges. As an example, if the payment method specifies a fee of 4.5%, you would receive $955 USDT from $1000 of USD ($45 in total fees).

"Introduction
Why the world
improvement
in the subject?
A
local testnet
is just a development tool, so it has mainly two requirements:
it must satisfy test cases requirements;
it should make the developers life quality as high as possible.
Our
local tesnet
(part of
cardano-js-sdk
) more than meets the first requirement while has a couple of problems about the second one:
it is not always so easy to update it to satisfy new test cases;
it is built using more standards: mixed yaml and json configuration files, mixed bash and JavaScript scripts...
its main issue is
it takes a dozen of minutes, at each run, to be ready
;
the main purpose of this proposal is to improve our
local tesnet
on these sides.
Core change proposal
The reason for the ~12' delay at startup is to let some epochs to go; some test cases requires this scenario.
The idea which originated this proposal is to
move
the activity performed inside the
testnet
from the
initial stage
of
docker run
phase to the
docker build
phase.
Implementation details
The structure of the network itself (more working
cardano-node
daemons with ad hoc network configuration and genesis) is pretty good, no changes on this side are planned.
Create a new TypeScript script which governs the
testnet
in all stages of its lifetime:
initialization: download and patch the network configuration and genesis files;
start up
and
shut down
the
cardano-node
s with the required customizations both for the
docker build
and the
docker run
phases;
perform the actions (i.e. submit the transactions) during the
docker build
phase to create all the required test cases;
Expose everything required to interact with the
testnet
(the socket, the mnemonics, the submitted tx ids to let the tests to know which are the txs concurring in creating the required test cases, the stake pool ids with their expected status, etc…) through a
docker volume
.
Side changes proposals
Publish on ghcr.io
Currently the
local testnet
is build through
docker compose
at each startup (
docker cache
helps saving time here) and it doesn’t exists as its own.
One more interesting improvement could be to publish it on ghcr.io .
Pros
One single build can serve all the developers.
SDK CI tests can download the pre-built image to save time on this side as well.
It can be used by other teams, also from outside IOG.
Cons
Requires more development time.
New dedicated github repository
Obviously, if the decision is not to publish it on ghcr.io, this makes no sense as the files need to live in the SDK repository.
On the other hand, an open source published docker image may deserves a dedicated repository to isolate documentation and support requests and to facilitate the contribution from the open source community.",How can the local testnet's long startup time and complex build process be improved through moving activities to the docker build phase and potentially publishing it on ghcr.io?,"The local testnet's long startup time can be improved by moving activities from the initial stage of the docker run phase to the docker build phase. This would involve creating a new TypeScript script that governs the testnet in all stages of its lifetime, including initialization, start up and shut down of the cardano-node daemons, performing actions during the docker build phase to create all required test cases, and exposing necessary information through a docker volume. Additionally, publishing the local testnet on ghcr.io could further improve the build process by allowing a single build to serve all developers, saving time for SDK CI tests, and making it available for use by other teams. However, this would require more development time and a new dedicated github repository."
"Danilo Prates
Rhys Bartels Waller",What is the significance of mentioning both Danilo Prates and Rhys Bartels Waller in this context?,"The significance of mentioning both Danilo Prates and Rhys Bartels Waller in this context is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that they are both individuals who are relevant in some capacity. Danilo Prates is mentioned first, which may suggest that he holds a more prominent role or is more well-known in the given context. Rhys Bartels Waller, on the other hand, is mentioned second and may be less known or have a smaller role. Without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact significance of mentioning these two individuals together."

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary (overall project)
DJED offers a blend of stability and decentralization. Designed to mitigate cryptocurrency volatility, DJED maintains a stable value, facilitating reliable transactions, and serving as a dependable medium for savings and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Leveraging Cardano's secure and scalable platform, promises lower transaction costs and enhanced efficiency. By integrating DJED into the lace wallet we believe [
hypothesis
], we will increase it’s usage by streamlining the experience from the get go at the moment any users creates/recovers a wallet in lace.
Risks/Concerns (overall project)
The integration of DJED and SHEN into the Lace wallet involves complex interactions between various components, including the user interface, the Cardano blockchain, and the smart contract itself. This complexity can lead to technical challenges such as interoperativility, scalability and synchronization issues.
Out of Scope (overall project)
NA
Phases
(note: there might be only one phase!)
Phase 1: Dev work + Design process
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
….
Lace wallet represents means to an end, the gateway to entering the Cardano space. DJED is the key to access all the DEFI universe of possibilities within our ecosystem. By merging these two projects, we believe we can increase visibility, onboard new users and full seamless DEFI experience in Cardano. In order to achieve this, we require work in two different fronts:
Front and back-end effort
Design effort
There are several questions that arise regarding what’s the best experience we can provide by integrating Djed into lace. Therefore, we need to go through a discovery process so we can properly define such UX and UI. Both effort can run in parallel.
Scope for this phase
Add support on the cardano-js-sdk for plutus scripts
Implement function to compute transaction body scriptDataHash
Expose endpoint in the SDK to compute execution units
Update input selection to support adding arbitrary inputs as part of the selection result
Update the transaction builder to support Plutus scripts
DJED Specific work on the SDK
Track liquidity
Track the state of the DJED smart contract
Contract Interaction
Work on the wallet
Discovery research process
Design and create Lace UI/UX in Lace based on research conclusion
Out of Scope for this phase
NA
Implementation Notes (incl Risks & Dependencies) for this phase
The work to do in the front-end is straight forward, we might require more support for the back-end
Should we build a solution sharable with the ecosystem so others wallets also support DJED?

Summary
On the
31 Jan 2024
Nami v3.7.0
was released, marking the first release since the IOG acquisition. All manual testing was successful, before and after the release, however some hours into the Chrome extension rollout phase, access to the backend API (Blockfrost) was failing due to the wrong API account key used in the build, and subsequent rate limiting in effect. After being notified in the Lace support channel of users discussing the outage in X (Twitter), the issue was diagnosed and ultimately service restored by re-provisioning the account receiving the API requests from Nami v3.7.0.
The intent of this release was to make a minimal update to:
Comply with IOG legal standards
Replace visual references from Berry Pool
Rework the delegation feature to not have Berry Pool as the only option
Remove legacy

option
Instrument the application for collecting anonymous analytics to better assess the user activity to develop a migration to Lace plan.
A decision was made to
not
fix legacy bugs, and
not
improve build or release processes, since there’s uncertainty on how we will proceed with retaining or incorporating the UX of Nami into Lace, which will be mostly be driven by data collected
after
this release has been made. It was however brought to our attention that the analytics implementation was potentially in violation of
article 7(3) of the GDPR
, as there was no feature to opt-out of the original decision made buy the user to opt-in.
Impact
Affected users were unable to sync chain state changes or submit transactions between the hours of
2130-0000
on
31 Jan 2024
and
0455-0824
on
01 Feb 2024
. Funds were secure and users could access the network via alternative wallet software, including Lace, which is a good backup strategy in general.

Resolved by increasing the account capacity

Total Requests to the security@iohk.io Blockfrost account (UTC+1)
Root Cause Analysis
Why did the API requests fail?
A valid but under-provisioned account key was used rather than the expected Nami account key, which is a
starter plan
key limited to 50k/reqs per day.
Why was this not discovered during pre-release testing?
The key provides identical access if the limit is not exceeded, and testing does not deplete the request balance.
Chrome extensions are rolled out to users over a number of hours, and the sanity checks were performed soon after the rollout began, before the account limit was reached.
How did the wrong API key get used?
All secret material is stored in VaultWarden, which is a shared service with users in various chapters and tribes. Prior to the Nami acquisition, an existing record was stored in the vault as below:
Contributing Factors
:
This record contained no username, which
could
have been set as the account identifier
security@iohk.io
to better identify it.
It was global and not restricted to only users who require access, presumably members of the security team.
Nami credentials were expected to be available in VaultWarden, and this vague record was assumed to be for Nami. Once it was set and demonstrated to be working, there was no reason to question its validity. The mistake was made during migration of credentials, where clearly the Nami account Blockfrost keys were not added to VaultWarden.
Why did we not notice the issue independently?
Nami uses Blockfrost as its backend, which has some level of monitoring from a service provider’s perspective, but its geared towards ensuring account capacity is sufficient rather than alerting based on usage patterns.
Why did it take ~6hrs for a response?
Posts made to the
#lace-support
channel are not covered by our on-call team and the timing meant it would be attended when eastern Europeans started their day.
Why was the notification made to the
#lace-support
channel rather than triggering an on-call response?
There is not an established process for communicating a potential service disruption since we have monitoring in place for Lace via the backend services we control.
Corrective Action Plan
Promote the
security@iohk.io
account to the same provisioning as
nami@iohk.io
Rename the vague VaultWarden item to avoid confusion in future
Request all items added to VaultWarden contain enough detail to properly identify account keys, and limit items to be added to the global space.
Add the missing item for Nami Blockfrost keys
Define a formal incident response plan, including notifying legal, and triggering an on-call response.
Create a crisis response plan, with input from legal.
Chrome extensions can be
configured for partial rollout
, as a percentage. We should investigate strategies to minimise impact in future, using the initial cohort to verify the update is not causing a disruption.
Automate the build in a GitHub workflow to reduce the chance of API key mismatch in future, and reduce the risk associated with building locally, plus make it auditable.
Update Nami to use the intended account API key
Demote the
security@iohk.io
account back to a starter plan once the update has rolled out completely.
Consider a notification hook feature in Blockfrost to set thresholds of expected usage per API endpoint. This could feed into our existing monitoring system to alert operations teams of the issue in real time.
Consider improvements in social network monitoring to improve reaction time.","What was the primary factor that contributed to the use of an under-provisioned API key in the Nami v3.7.0 release, leading to the service outage?","The primary factor that contributed to the use of an under-provisioned API key in the Nami v3.7.0 release, leading to the service outage, was the vague record in VaultWarden.

        Pre-release:
        - Identify the individuals or teams who have the necessary expertise and skills to manage incidents.
        - Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each person or team, including incident commander, technical leads, and communication liaisons.
        - Establish a rotation schedule for incident management duties, ensuring that there is adequate coverage during peak hours and high-risk periods.
        - Provide training and resources to help team members prepare for incident management duties, including incident response plans, playbooks, and communication protocols.

        Post-release:
        - Continuously monitor the system for any abnormalities or issues that may require incident management.
        - Evaluate the severity level of each situation and determine if it warrants being escalated to an incident.
        - Assign the appropriate incident management team based on the severity level and nature of the issue.
        - Communicate clearly and effectively with all stakeholders, including customers, team members, and external partners, to keep them informed of the incident status and resolution efforts.
        - Document all incident management activities, including root cause analysis, corrective actions, and lessons learned, to improve future incident response efforts."

Candidates for 1.10 release
In this version of Lace we’ve included the below candidates:
1/ 3
Transaction Representation improvement
(click for more details)
Our current Tx representation looks wrong or incomplete in several scenarios. This area is quite important given that most Lace’s traffic come from DApps, and majority of scams are carried out through the DApp bridge. As of now, users that interact with dapps can’t see the whole view of what the Tx is carrying, not knowing what exactly they’re signing. This situation opens up many scenarios where the user is subject to fraud, which as a financial product raises deep concerns. Recent events in Cardano ecosystem have highlighted the weakness of wallets protecting users, including Lace.  Here are some example of recent events:
-
Wallet drained 1
(mint case)
-
Wallet drained 2
465k ADA stolen (NFT gift ADA drop scam)
-
Wallet drained 3
101k ADA stolen + NFTs (mint case)
- Discussion thread 1
""This is a wallet UX issue""
-
Discussion thread 2
""
We’re not ready for mass adoption.""
-
Discussion thread 3
-
Discussion thread 4
""Cardano wallets implement better TX previews and potentially even warning messages for when suspicious Txs arrive""
While all Cardano wallets are exposed to this problem, Lace is currently behind top wallets.
This feature addresses part of the concerns voiced by the community in the fundamental base (possible and recommended to add more features on top). It’s composed of many small improvements that overall create a large impact of the dapp interaction experience. The scope has been split in three phases to deliver incremental value.
In Lace 1.10 we are releasing Phase 1 out of 3, which looks at:
Add a summary in the DApp bridge (wallet connect/ DApp connector) of all assets involved in the Tx from the wallet POV, summarizing to users what are the changes about to be executed on their wallet
Add NFTs thumbnails to the DApp bridge summary
Add collateral information to the DApp bridge, supporting former and output collateral types
Remove address redundancies in input/output sections: show only addresses in one section
By the end of this phase, in the DApp bridge of Lace, users will be able to easily read all asset information carried in the Tx requested to be signed, having a clean summary of assets being exchanged from the wallet POV, including thumbnails for NFTs and support for the new collateral output.

This information can inform the design of the migration process and help ensure that it is user-friendly and meets user needs. The proposed channels and methods for capturing user feedback include surveys, interviews, focus groups, and user testing. These methods can be used to gather both quantitative and qualitative data on user experiences and perceptions of the migration process. It is important to involve stakeholders such as Danilo Prates, Ian Cross, Rodolpho Ribeiro, and the legal department in the user research process to ensure that their perspectives and concerns are taken into account. Additionally, creating Jira tasks for the Marcomms and Ecosystem teams can help ensure that user feedback is captured and addressed in a timely and effective manner."

Conclusion:
During January we’ve noticed a
significant decrease in unique users
and overall activity on the website.
29.5% less uniques and 31.5% less SEO generated visitors
have visited
lace.io
, which is expected after a longer period of not publishing new content on our blog/ website.
Most traffic is direct (1,515), followed by google (702). We’ve seen a slight increase in traffic generated  from
Namiwallet.io
.
We’ve also noticed an increase in visitors arriving on
lace.io
via a logo placed on
adahandle.com
On January 8th we’ve release a hotfix, Lace 1.8.1, and that generated a bit more traffic from twitter.
There is a decrease of 21.9% in the unique website visitors that ‘added lace to their browser’, however, the
conversion rate still remains above average at 36.05%.
From this month’s data, we can see some moderate spikes in unique users on the following days: 3rd January (128), 10th (115), 25th (106). This month’s been quieter and we’ve not had content to correlate to these slight increases in traffic.
The conversion time slightly decreased by 1 minute
As expected, most of our visitors are from the USA, followed by Indonesia, Canada, Australia and the UK.
It seems that we gained more of the North America and Asia traffic, but decreased in Europe
.
The
most successful campaign is the Nami banner on our homepage
The most accessed page is the homepage, as expected, followed by features, then FAQs.
Out of 2,195 unique users, 556 people visited
lace.io
from their mobiles.

"Background
The
https://github.com/input-output-hk/lace-mobile
repository is our starting point, which was the codebase setup as part of the Lace mobile POC skunkworks project, running from February 2023 to October 2023, where it was parked due to strategy changes within IOG.

The
design
implements layering based on
DDD
, supporting the development of headless features in isolation that can then be applied in various applications, both multiple platforms for Lace, and also entirely different wallet applications such as Nami.
The key management architecture is considerate of
multi-chain requirements
, so can therefore be considered for extension to support additional chains.
There’s been an intention to move some arguably Lace-centric functionality, that was written into the
cardano-js-sdk
, into Lace, to remove friction associated with the isolated SDLC. This includes both frontend and backend aspects.
Summary
After completing some codebase chores, to remove the specificity as this being constrained to a mobile version of Lace, and reviewing the architecture to ensure it stands up the new project requirements, the backend source code will be moved and deployed continuously for the
dev-*
environments. Wallet code from the SDK will also be moved in and the packages published for the legacy codebase to consume during for the interim. From here a minimum browser extension will be setup, bringing parity to the two applications present, with a semi-automated release process similar to the
cardano-js-sdk
, and then the list of supported chains extended to include Midnight Shielded. The final stage of this project then is focused on bringing across the remaining features, one-by-one, eventually being able to release a version of Lace extension for Cardano from the new codebase.
While the primary focus is on the browser extension, depending on capacity, we could also re-initiate the mobile development in parallel as soon as the lower level domain elements are implemented.
Phases
1 - Prepare
Rename GitHub repository to
lace-mc
(Lace multi-chain) or
xsy-wallet
. The latter better suits sourcing multiple wallet products, including Lace and Nami.
Rework documentation to position the mobile product as just one application
Upgrade dependencies
Enforce Conventional Commits via GitHub workflow
Conventional Commits training material (
Piotr Czeglik
)
Perform architecture review, challenging the design to ensure it covers the new requirements of adding a Lace browser extension an potentially a Nami rebuild.
Define engineering SOPs
All members part of
lace-activity
Slack channel, user account associated with GitHub account
In context PR discussion happens in this channel using the threads created by the bot (not in squad channels)
2 - Migrate SDK Code
Common
Finalise any open PRs relating to the code we’re about to move
The provider interfaces
e2e tests
Local network caching to remove dead 25mins of setup, maybe with S3 now it’s higer perf.
These will be considered integration tests in the context of Lace
Backend
Migrate
cardano-services
from the SDK repo into
lace-mc
as
backend
Switch
lace-ops
to use this as the source, which should be a drop-in replacement
Setup continuous deployment for dev environments, using branch merge as the trigger:
dev-sanchonet
dev-preview
dev-preprod
dev-mainnet
Simple configuration - Developer friendly
Full local development environment with a local network removing the strict dependency on public testnets.
Frontend
wallet package
web-extension
Publish package under
@lace
, or
@xsywallet
, namespace for consumption in the existing Lace codebase during the transition.
3 - Limited Feature Migration
Chain selector
Onboarding flow
Create wallets, activate accounts
View wallet
Send/Receive
Critical chain-specific backend config
4 - Initiate Midnight Shielded  (In parallel with phase 3)
Local proof server setup
With the basic features implemented, including the chain selector, extend to support Midnight Shielded Ledger.
Use a feature flag
5 - Finalise and release browser extension Cardano
All remaining features from the Lace product migrated here.
The goal is to have the whole team move across to be developing in this codebase.
The architecture is sympathetic to parallel features being developed concurrently
6 - Mobile Feature Parity (Cardano only, in parallel with phase 3 and 4)
This development could be continued in parallel with phase 3, after a small offset, implementing the lower level components being written to support the browser extension.

,In the context of,"Context:
        The 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were the first games to feature two new sports: golf and rugby sevens. The games were held from August 5 to August 21, 2016. The United States topped the medal count with 121 total medals, including 46 golds. China finished second with 70 total medals, 26 of which were gold. Great Britain finished third with 67 total medals, 27 of which were gold.

        Question: In the context of which country topped the medal count at the 2016 Summer Olympics?

        Answer: The United States topped the medal count at the 2016 Summer Olympics with a total of 121 medals, including 46 golds."
"About this document
The goal is for the Lace Tribe to be doing a rolling 3-month forecast on a monthly basis. Every third month this will coincide with IOG’s PI Cycle.
This document captures Lace’s first 3-month forecast of 2024, that presented during IOG’s PI5-2024 process on
06 Feb 2024
- this presentation date is reflected in the page title
Lace Heads had hoped to be in a position to do a new 3-month forecast in the first week of March. At of today (
11 Mar 2024
) we have not yet managed to do that, though progress is being made
When we
do
have a new 3-month forecast, this document will be archived and a new doc will be created in the parent folder:

Exec Summary
Project Execution Summary -
We have 6 weeks left until the end of PI5. In that time, we expect to cut at least 2-3 more releases, which will capture a large majority of remaining planned work.
Nami bug resolution
is on track from the XSY side of things with ticket resolution comms in approval and bug fix merged and awaiting audit.
Starting off the work required for the Nami Migration tool. Regardless of CH opinion on nami-mode, this will still be valuable work. The shared wallets beta will be descoped in order to bring this effort in.
As mentioned in previous update, finishing up a significant re-work of our epics in progress to focus on MVPs. Lots of unnecessary work was trimmed without much impact to the product delivery.
Important meetings with midnight leadership this week - need to understand longer term timelines.

Lace v1.9: Slack channel for Progress Graphs
20 Feb 2024
Current scope of the v1.9 release has been amended to: Multi-Wallet / Multi-Account + One tranche (out of 3) of Tx Rep Improvements
Lace Heads Trio met today and cut Trezor Support plus less-urgent elements of Multi-Wallet / Multi-Account out of v1.9, producing the scope cuts & improved timing prospects visible in the graphs. Slack write-up visible in the xsy-lace channel

Scope of v1.10 is increasing as work is removed from v1.9, eg Trezor Mappers and Multi-Wallet/Multi-Account are in v1.10 scope. Once we are on the home straight for v1.9 we will need to revisit v1.10 scope, which is now probably too large

Shared Wallets: Slack channel for Progress Graphs
Forecast effort: -
Background
Shared-wallet = a wallet owned/managed by multiple people/entities. Privacy conscious users will be able to manually choose their own communication channels to coordinate management (signing, transacting, etc) of this shared wallet.
This will be a Beta release, so independent of normal Lace Browser releases to Chrome/Edge stores
19 Feb 2024
Since late January, when v1.9 provisional scope was i) broadly agreed ii) did not include Shared Wallets (ie it was deprioritised relative to 1.9), this has had almost no work done on it
There is nothing in current trends to give high confidence that Shared Wallets (with 19 tickets unresolved) will be complete in mid-March (as per PI Plan)

, has anyone set/got any expectations about this?
27 Feb 2024
Session was held to define requirement for the update:
P2P support readiness
Hard Fork readiness
Update of vulnerable libraries and packages
Ongoing discussions of what node version should be supported.  The current release node version is 8.7.3 that neither support P2P or Hard Fork readiness.
From Core Tech, it looks like 8.9.1 is the version that should be targetted.
Regarding QA resourcing.  From discussions with QA Lead, we have QA resource that covers all 3 platforms ie Windows, Linux and MacOS.  However, it should be noted that to regression test on Daedalus can take up to 5 working days.
04 Mar 2024
Currently there is an issue with Trezor Hardware wallet integration after Daedalus was build with the new cardano-node and cardano-wallet
Investigation is under way to resolved this
It is currently targetted to get the release out by end of March.

-The current terms of use is not compliant with IOG’s legal standards.
-There is no privacy policy to review and approve as part of the onboarding.
-All supporting properties also require tweaks, such as the website and Chrome store listing, as they’re referencing Berry pool or below IOG legal standards.
-Delegations are made directly to Berry pool, which remains the property of Alesandro.
-We have no insight on the usage of Nami, given there’s no analytics in place.
-The release aims to address the above issues, in a minimal way, removing the legal risk and allowing users to delegate to any pool. We also gain intelligence into the current usage patterns, allowing us to plan the user migration with data backed decisions.
Under a heading of “further Nami-related work” we have a goal of “migrate many thousands of users”, but we do not currently know what a reasonable success would look like in terms of numbers migrated nor timescales.

So to keep building and maintaining an engaged community within XSY/Lace, I’ve decided to outline some of our current costs plus potential additional costs if a rough budget – ring-fenced, of USD2,500 per year is approved.
If the current budget is to be moved/allocated to XSY, it’s important to bear in mind the existing costs covered by IOG.
Current Discord Running Costs
(covered by IOG)
Jira ticket for existing procurement request:
Discord Nitro subscription for community manager ($99.99/year)
DIscord Lace server boosts ($52/month)
Bots ($8/month)
Total: approximately
$717/year.
Proposed Additional Costs
Additional bots ($99/per year): for added stats and analytics, engagement initiatives and gamification)
Kahoot! 360 Pro subscription ($740/year): for quizzes and interactive presentations. Can be used for engagement initiatives but also Product masterclasses
Total: additional
$839/year.
Giveaways/Airdrops/Merch costs
Estimated $1,000 in merch and competitions, including postage and handling costs.
Revenue Option
Given that Lace has a very appealing branding, we could upload our designs and other assets to the merch platform
https://www.spreadshop.com/merchandise-creator
, in order to offset some of our marketing costs mentioned above.","""What would be the total annual cost for the proposed Discord upgrades and engagement initiatives, assuming a budget of USD2,500 per year, with approximately $717 currently covered by IOG and an estimated $1,000 for merch and competitions?""","The total annual cost for the proposed Discord upgrades and engagement initiatives, assuming a budget of USD2,500 per year, with approximately $717 currently covered by IOG and an estimated $1,000 for merch and competitions, would be $2,500 - $717 - $1,000 = $833. This amount includes the proposed additional costs of $839/year for additional bots and a Kahoot! 360 Pro subscription, minus the $8/month for bots that is already covered by IOG. The remaining budget of $833 can be used for other engagement initiatives or marketing costs."

analytics
DappRadar is useful to both users and developers. Developers get access to important information such as
user behaviour, competition, and market movements
. Knowing all this, they can enhance their own Dapps and provide better user experiences.
Lace DApp Store MVP doesn’t yet offer access to user behaviour and data regarding usage/ competition
Real-time metrics
This tool enables
real-time insights and up-to-date information on a variety of metrics
such as transaction volumes, token usage, and user activity. This helps users in making timely and informed decisions according to the current state of the crypto market.
Our application does no offer this capability
On-chain registration for DApps
DappRadar doesn not offer on-chain registration of the DApps
Our product uses on-chain DApp registration making it a truly decentralized Web3 platform
User-friendly interface
Complex interface
DappRadar includes a user interface that is
not really beginner-friendly
. For newcomers, it might appear complex to navigate.
Easy-to-use interface
for seasoned pros and newcomers
Machine learning algorithm
DappRadar
uses on-chain data to track and analyse the performance of Dapps
. At the same time, it
tracks data manually and uses machine learning algorithms to optimise it.
Machine learning algorithms are also used to
provide users with estimates of the value of their NFTs.
Our product doesn’t have scoped such a feature
Certifications
DappRadar doesn’t show any certification levels in their interface for the displayed DApps
For this iteration certifications are out of scope. However, the plan is to allow developers to add existing audit reports and we’ll display them as
Level 0.
We believe that with this feature users can choose higher security DApps.
Ranking system
It employs a categorisation and ranking system that aids users in exploring Dapps according to their needs and preferences. The system lays down Dapps into specific categories such as finance, gaming, and more.
Each Dapp gets its ranking based on key factors such as transaction volume and user engagement
.
For this iteration the ranking system is out of scope. However, the next iterations are exploring
community reviews/ ranking/ curation
.
We believe that our system is more decentralized and offers a realistic curation

DappRadar's interface, while not beginner-friendly, offers a wide range of features and information that can be overwhelming for newcomers, but it also provides valuable insights for experienced users. On the other hand, Lace DApp Store MVP is currently more focused on providing developer-friendly analytics, which may not be as appealing to non-developer users.

        Community reviews and a decentralized ranking system could have a significant impact on Lace's market position by increasing user engagement and trust. By allowing users to rate and review DApps, Lace could create a more transparent and community-driven ecosystem, which could attract more users and developers to the platform. Additionally, a decentralized ranking system could provide a more objective and fair way of showcasing the best DApps, which could help Lace establish itself as a trusted source for Web3 decentralized applications.

        However, it's important to note that DappRadar has already established itself as an industry leader in the DApp space, and it has a significant advantage in terms of brand recognition and partnerships. Therefore, Lace will need to differentiate itself in other ways, such as providing unique features or services that are not available on DappRadar, in order to attract users and developers to its platform."

Exec Summary
There are several challenges we’ve identified as part of our lace analytics refactor initiative, particularly around manual updates, tracking complexities, discrepancies in user counts, and onboarding drop-ins and drop-offs. The problem space describes the inefficiency of manually updating Google Chrome Store metrics, complexities in tracking opt-ins versus opt-outs for anonymous analytics, discrepancies between the total number of users and those segmented by country, and challenges monitoring user drop-off post-onboarding. Additionally, it concerns the uncertainty surrounding the data storage solution, possibly PostHog's data warehouse, and the need for further investigation into data integrity and reporting accuracy.
By taking a first principles approach we decompose the problem into its purest form to successfully reactor lace-analytics. The explanation below describes the relationship between each phase and the most common dependencies among these stages.
Moreover, the proposed strategy introduces a, risk-mitigated approach to deploying new features to Lace users, incorporating canary releases, tiered feature flags, A/B testing, and PostHog Surveys. By initially releasing updates to a select group of users and employing feature flags for a controlled rollout, the strategy allows for close monitoring of performance against key metrics, ensuring minimal impact on user experience. Tiered feature flags enable a segmented release process, targeting specific user tiers like highly active users for a more tailored approach. A/B testing provides critical insights by comparing user responses to different feature versions. At the same time, PostHog Surveys offer a deeper understanding of user sentiment, both of which are instrumental in refining and optimizing features. This integrated framework provides a user-centric, data-driven feature rollout, enhancing user satisfaction and adoption rates.
Business Understanding
The business understanding phase is essential because it helps stakeholders and the team understand what we’re working with and the resources available for example.
Available resources? (Data engineers/scientist, data-infrastructure, tools, budget)
What are the primary problems? And how to best approach the problem given the available resources we have today.
What are the primary goals?
Data Understanding
This step involves granting access to the essential individuals required to review the data, explore the tables and determine whether the available existing data is sufficient enough to answer the questions we seek to answer.
Review existing data sources, Google Chrome Store metrics and PostHog Analytics.
Assess data quality, consistency, and reliability. Also, addressing any missing values and how this is managed.
Identify relevant data attributes for analysis e.g., which columns are we including as part our modeling.
Identify Irrelevant Attributes, e.g, which columns can we safely exclude from analysis due to a lack of relevance to a specific objectives?
The data can take a variety of formats, therefore documenting the value types such as numeric, categorical (string), or Boolean (true/false) can mitigate any issues during the
Data Preparation
Automate data integration processes to streamline ChromeStore data collection.
Implement data validation and cleaning procedures to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Address discrepancies in user counts and other data inconsistencies.
Modeling & Visualization
Updates the PostHog and ChromeStore Dashboard after we’ve prepared and cleaned the data.
Implement analytics features in PostHog, such as funnel analysis, path analysis, cohort analysis, and user lifecycle metrics.
Determine types of algorithms we’ll need to build new models given the business needs e.g., predictive modeling methods.
Evaluation:
Evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented model compared to the previous model.
Measure improvements in data accuracy, efficiency, and insights gained.
Gather general stakeholder feedback that support improving XSY business intelligence.
Deployment
Deploy the updated analytics after successfully passing the evaluation phase
We may start with manual updates but should strive for automated updates.
Establish regular monitoring and maintenance procedures for continued effectiveness.
Provide documentation updates to relevant stakeholders.
Iteration:
Monitor and iterate on the analytics processes based on needs and changing requirements.
Implement improvements and optimization to enhance analytics capabilities and reporting.
Stay abreast of new technologies and methodologies in the field of data analytics and incorporate relevant advancements as needed.

Phases
Phase 1:
Summary
The scope aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the Lace Chrome Store Dashboard through automation, eliminating the need for manual updates. It includes investigating data integrity for both the Lace Chrome Store and PostHog platforms, aiming to identify and document any discrepancies or inaccuracies that could affect data analysis. The scope also examines an identified issue where the number of unique users does not align with country-segmented data, indicating potential data collection or processing flaws. Following verifying and rectifying these data integrity issues, the project will update existing dashboards and create a new ""Lace Pulse"" dashboard focused on essential product-market fit metrics, streamlining data visualization, and enhancing decision-making processes.

Dependencies
Phase 2:
Summary
The proposed areas include integrating canary releases, tiered feature flags, and PostHog Surveys into a deployment strategy that offers a comprehensive, risk-mitigated approach to introducing new features to lace users.
Initially releasing changes to a small subset of users, the strategy employs feature flags to facilitate a controlled, gradual rollout. This enables the Lace product team to closely monitor business KPIs and operational metrics and, ensure minimal impact on the overall user experience, and validate our hypothesis.
Tiered feature flags further enhance this approach by allowing for a systematic release across different user tiers or segments, such as prioritizing highly active users. This segmentation supports a more tailored and controlled rollout, addressing potential issues before they affect a wider audience.
Incorporating A/B testing into the mix enables the team to compare user responses to different feature versions, providing valuable insights into user preferences and behavior. This data-driven approach helps refine and optimize features based on real user feedback.
Additionally, utilizing PostHog Surveys to gather qualitative feedback complements the quantitative data from A/B testing, offering a holistic view of user sentiment towards new or existing features. This qualitative feedback is crucial for understanding user needs, preferences, and issues encountered, guiding further improvements and adjustments to the feature rollout process.
Together, these strategies form a robust framework for deploying new features in a controlled, informed, and user-centric manner, minimizing risks while maximizing the potential for positive user experiences and successful feature adoption.
Scope for this phase
Enable Canary Release
A canary release is a deployment strategy whereby changes are initially released to a small subset of users. The system is then carefully monitored for signs of trouble, using both business KPIs and operational metrics.
Enable Tiered Release
The goal of tiered deployments is to gradually release new features across different lace user tiers or segments. The strategy allows for controlled and gradual rollout, which supports addressing any issues early on, minimizing the potential impact on the entire lace user base, in effort for a smoother, more stable release.
Enable PostHog Surveys
Implement PosthHog Surveys to better understand user-satisfaction, user-needs and frustrations within the wallet.
Funnel Analysis
Measure how many users complete or drop out of a sequence of actions.
Measure Stickiness
What keeps users coming back by viewing the interval between repeated actions
Session Replay

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary
Our current Tx representation looks wrong or incomplete in several scenarios. This area is quite important given that most Lace’s traffic come from dapps, and majority of scams are carried out through the dapp bridge. As of now, users that interact with dapps can’t see the whole view of what the Tx is carrying, not knowing what exactly they’re signing. This situation opens up many scenarios where the user is subject to fraud, which as a financial product raises deep concerns. Recent events in Cardano ecosystem have highlighted the weakness of wallets protecting users, including Lace.  Here are some example of recent events:
-
Wallet drained 1
(mint case)
-
Wallet drained 2
465k ADA stolen (NFT gift ADA drop scam)
-
Wallet drained 3
101k ADA stolen + NFTs (mint case)
- Discussion thread 1
""This is a wallet UX issue""
-
Discussion thread 2
""
We’re not ready for mass adoption.""
-
Discussion thread 3
-
Discussion thread 4
""Cardano wallets implement better TX previews and potentially even warning messages for when suspicious Txs arrive""
While all Cardano wallets are exposed to this problem, Lace is currently behind top wallets.
This feature addresses part of the concerns voiced by the community in the fundamental base (possible and recommended to add more features on top). It’s composed of many small improvements that overall create a large impact of the dapp interaction experience. The scope has been split in three phases to deliver incremental value.
Risks/Concerns
No risks identified
Phases
Phase 1: DApp Connector/Bridge Revamp
Scope for this phase
Add a summary in the dapp bridge of all assets involved in the Tx from the wallet POV, summarizing to users what are the changes about to be executed on their wallet (attack vector)
Add NFTs thumbnails to the dapp bridge summary
Add collateral information to the dapp bridge, supporting former and output collateral types
Remove address redundancies in input/output sections: show only addresses in one section
Add balance style to Tx events
By the end of this phase, in the dapp bridge of Lace, users will be able to easily read all asset information carried in the Tx requested to be signed, having a clean summary of assets being exchanged from the wallet POV, including thumbnails for NFTs and support for the new collateral output.
Jira:
Phase 2: Own/foreign tags in addresses
Scope for this phase
Add transaction lifespan
Distinguish between own and external addresses
By the end of this phase, in Lace dapp bridge & Tx details , users will be able to differentiate external and internal  addresses when reviewing a Tx signing request, or in activity Tx details, and review Tx validity as well.
Jira:
Phase 3: Enhanced Security & UX
Scope for this phase
Show certificates info in Tx details & DApp bridge
Distinguish between own and external certificates
Add Tx status
signed &

confirmation
status (attack vector)
Warn users when recipient is a smartcontract address (send flow)
Validate transaction metadata hash & show warning if it doesn’t match with actual metadata
Warn users when Tx input(s) cannot be resolved on-chain in Tx chaining scenarios (attack vector)
Add Tx failure type for plutus phase 2 validation
Support custom metadata labels in Tx details
By the end of this phase:
Lace will notify users of unexpected Tx constructions, like unresolved inputs, non-matching metadata hashes or smart contract recipients in the send flow.
Lace will support for certificates in the dapp bridge, and enhancing the tracking of a Tx that has been signed, adding more statuses and a proper tracking once the Tx has made it to the blockchain
Jira:
Success Criteria/KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
2 months after each release, weekly Tx traffic submitted through the dapp bridge has increased 5% per each phase, totaling 15% increase once all phases are released.
2 months after the phase 3 release, user retention has increased 15%

"Nami user research
Lace user survey February 2024
Survey methodology (educational)
Onboarding revamp feedback
[Screening survey] Have you switched wallets?","For users who have switched wallets, what feedback did they provide regarding the onboarding revamp, and how does this compare to the results of the Nami user research and Lace user survey from February 2024?","For users who have switched wallets, the feedback regarding the onboarding revamp was not explicitly stated in the context. However, it can be inferred that these users may have found the previous onboarding process lacking in some way, prompting them to switch to a different wallet.
        
        Comparing this to the Nami user research and Lace user survey from February 2024, it is not possible to make a direct comparison as the context does not provide specific feedback or data from these sources. However, it can be noted that the onboarding revamp feedback from users who have switched wallets may provide valuable insights into areas where the revamp could be improved.
        
        To make a more informed comparison, it would be necessary to have access to the specific feedback and data from the Nami user research and Lage user survey. Without this information, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about how the feedback from users who have switched wallets compares to these sources."

"Context
Problem:
We don’t have enough data/analytics about Nami users previous and post to the acquisition
Without this data we can’t make an informed business decision regarding Nami’s future and its users.
Goals:
Have substantial data to justify why users use and have used Nami, to better understand our next moves in terms of strategy for user migration.
Strategy
Due to the short timeline we have for this research, we’ll start with a list of assumptions about Nami persona and usage, to try validating our believes.
Using IOG, Nami, and Lace channels we plan to capture quantitative and qualitative data from the Nami users, via the Cardano community. We’ll employ a survey, Social media/ Community polls and user interviews. Then we’ll try to map our findings against the PostHog analytics for the website and Nami wallet to create a wider picture.

        These assumptions align with the analytics captured from Nami's website and wallet usage in the following ways:

        1. The analytics show that Nami's website and wallet have a simple and minimal design, which aligns with the assumption that Nami users value minimal UI/UX design.
        2. The analytics show that Nami's wallet has been used to send and receive NFTs, which aligns with the assumption that Nami users are interested in NFT-friendly features.
        3. The analytics do not provide direct evidence of user interest in a new wallet that combines the best features of Nami and Lace. However, the analytics do show that there is some overlap in the user base of Nami and Lace, which suggests that there may be interest in such a product.

        In summary, the key assumptions and potential delighter features for Nami wallet users align with the analytics captured from Nami's website and wallet usage in several ways. However, more research is needed to fully understand the needs and preferences of Nami users, and to determine the best strategy for user migration."

Context
A feature is being improved over a number of individual steps, involving a number of engineers, where incremental changes is not desired.
The main branch
could
be released at any time
The incremental code integration is not violating the rules around atomic commits, that technically are functional standalone, but the changes are desired to be released together as a single user story.
One option is to maintain a so called “integration branch”, AKA a staging branch, which allows the individual PRs to be merged and integrated with peer contributions, then the complete change merged to the
main
branch when ready to release. Taking this approach requires tedious and ongoing merging of downstream changes to avoid drift with
main
and handle merge conflicts when they’re closer to the origin.
Alternatively, a feature flag can be implemented to selectively build the alternative version so the code can be merged safely to master, then enabled once ready.

Consequences
Using a feature flag in this scenario may require additional development effort, since there’s effectively two features being maintained concurrently, however targeting the
main
branch reduces the work involved in keeping the staging branch in sync, so this is negligible in most cases.
There’s some risk the added complexity introduces bugs, although this should be mitigated already with the testing strategy.

"What are we adding to this release?
Fix the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68
Per the recommendation of the
pool.pm
team and in compliance with metadata standards, we sometimes see NFT IPFS links represented as arrays of strings. These arrays are meant to be concatenated directly to produce the IPFS link (or data scheme, etc.). Because the image is retrieved in the send assets page, without this change users are UNABLE to send assets in CIP-68 format (since the decimals do not get properly set in
nami/src/api/extension/index.js#1762
.
As it is impacting current minters of NFTs on CIP-68. There is a large collection just minted (Galacticats) where assets are frozen in individuals’ wallets.
Please note the NFT were always accessible by using another wallet, so the users were not completely stuck

Legal & Analytics implementation

After adding a wallet in Nami, it should be possible to opt in and opt out of analytics tracking
It should include an explanation about what we are tracking
A new section called Legal should be added to the top-level Settings page, with the items:
Analytics -
icon and a toggle
Terms of Service - when clicking, it should display the Terms of Service overlay
Privacy Policy - when clicking, it should display the Privacy Policy overlay
When hovering over the

        This update will have an impact on the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68. Currently, NFT IPFS links are sometimes represented as arrays of strings, which are meant to be concatenated directly to produce the IPFS link. However, this is not currently being done properly, which is causing issues with the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68. To fix this issue, the Nami wallet should be updated to properly concatenate these arrays to produce the IPFS link, allowing users to send assets in CIP-68 format. This is particularly important for a large collection of NFTs called Galacticats, where assets are currently frozen in individuals’ wallets due to this issue.
        
        In summary, the Nami wallet should be updated in this release to allow users to opt in and out of analytics tracking and to fix the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68. These updates will have an impact on the handling of user data and the display of NFTs, respectively."
"Timeframe: 14th January - 18th February
Executive summary
We’ve implemented PostHog analytics in Nami wallet and website (14th Jan), and we’ll revise the metrics during 14th Jan - 18th Feb 2024;
During this time, we’ve noticed
8,180 active users
, with a
peak of 1,382 DAU on 2nd February
, which coincides with the stir on social media;
https://soquest.xyz/
is one of the top referral domains. This rewards platform
allows just for one Cardano wallet to connect - that is Nami wallet
.
The highest referring traffic comes directly,
followed by an unidentifiable traffic source. I am not sure if this lack of tracking is a bad set up in PostHog or this domain has some blockers that inhibit tracking.
The scenario occurs multiple times.
Most accessed browser is Chrome, and the highest conversion rate at 13.25%
Opera and Samsung Internet
, while having lower access numbers,
show relatively high conversion rates of 9.71% and 10.20%,
respectively, indicating potential niches where users are more likely to convert.
The PostHog analytics also show metrics from ‘Android mobile’ and ‘Facebook Mobile’ as tracked browsers, however, it’s unclear how these are quantified as browsers.
The cohort chart indicates a low engagement in Nami wallet on a weekly basis

Weekly retention of users
From the weekly cohort chart below we can identify very little product usage on a weekly basis","""What insights can be gained from the PostHog analytics of Nami wallet and website regarding user behavior, referral domains, and conversion rates during the timeframe of January 14th to February 18th, 2024, and what are the potential implications for improving user engagement and conversion?""","During the timeframe of January 14th to February 18th, 2024, PostHog analytics were implemented for Nami wallet and website. The analytics revealed that there were 8,180 active users, with a peak of 1,382 daily active users (DAU) on February 2nd. The highest referring domain was <https://soquest.xyz/>, which only allows connection with one Cardano wallet, Nami wallet. Direct traffic and unidentifiable traffic sources were the top referrers, with the latter possibly due to tracking issues or domain blockers. Chrome was the most accessed browser, while Opera and Samsung Internet showed high conversion rates, indicating potential niches for user conversion.

        The cohort chart showed low engagement on a weekly basis, with only a small percentage of users returning to the platform. The conversion funnel showed that Chrome had the highest number of users accessing the website, with 13.25% converting after three pageviews. Safari, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera also had conversion rates above 4%, while Samsung Internet had a high conversion rate of 10.20%. However, Android mobile and Facebook Mobile had low conversion rates, with none and two conversions respectively.

        To improve user engagement and conversion, the following insights can be considered:

        1. Focus on increasing weekly engagement by implementing features that encourage users to return to the platform.
        2. Optimize the website for Chrome, as it is the most accessed browser and has a high conversion rate.
        3. Explore the potential niches of Opera and Samsung Internet users, as they have high conversion rates.
        4. Investigate the unidentifiable traffic sources to improve tracking and understand the user journey.
        5. Improve the user experience for Android mobile and Facebook Mobile users, as they have low conversion rates.
        6. Encourage referrals from the top referring domain, <https://soquest.xyz/>, by offering incentives or rewards.
        7. Monitor conversion rates and user behavior regularly to identify trends and areas for improvement."

Potentials (from Ian):
What do you think about Nami being acquired [maybe insert link]?
(need help with phrasing this one)
Why did you first install Nami? (or, How did you discover Nami)","What unique feature or innovation do you believe is currently missing in Cardano wallets, and how has your experience with the Nami Wallet influenced your perspective on this matter?","In the context provided, the unique feature or innovation currently missing in Cardano wallets is the ability to easily manage multiple accounts and connect to various hardware wallets, such as Trezor and Ledger. The Nami Wallet has influenced my perspective on this matter by providing a user-friendly interface for managing multiple accounts and connecting to hardware wallets, making it easier for users to securely store and manage their assets. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of providing a more seamless experience for connecting to different hardware wallets and managing multiple accounts. Overall, the missing feature or innovation in Cardano wallets is the ability to easily manage multiple accounts and connect to various hardware wallets, which would provide users with a more secure and convenient way to store and manage their assets."
"In the upcoming Nami user research, we plan to leverage its status as a mature product, allowing us to start with informed assumptions about its users rather than conducting research from zero.
Considerations
Here are the key considerations that informed our assumptions:
Nami, an early light wallet, capitalized on the last bull market
It offers straightforward UX
It’s considered a good wallet for visualizing NFTs
It misses features present in newer wallets like Eternl and Typhon, such as multiple soft wallets, multiple addresses, and, until the last release, could not delegate to other stake pools
Some users don’t understand that it’s possible to use more than one Cardano wallet app for the same wallet, at same time
Assumptions
Based on the aforementioned considerations, here are our main assumptions about Nami wallet users.
Some or many Nami users likely…
…chose Nami early on, when it was one of the few light wallets, or when it was one of the only options for NFT visualization, and stuck to it
…prefer Nami because it has a better NFT visualization than Eternl and other Cardano wallets
…installed Nami during the bull market peak and might not be very active now
…use Nami for specific functions, such as NFT visualization, and other wallets for different activities, like Daedalus for HODL
…appreciate Nami's strong ties to the Cardano community and early support of Cardano features
…might not explore other wallets or advanced features due to a lack of technical knowledge about the Recovery Phrase","What proportion of Nami wallet users likely continue to use Nami primarily for its NFT visualization capabilities, as opposed to other wallet features or activities?","Based on the context, it is likely that a significant proportion of Nami wallet users continue to use Nami primarily for its NFT visualization capabilities. The context states that Nami is considered a good wallet for visualizing NFTs and that some users prefer Nami because it has a better NFT visualization than Eternl and other Cardano wallets. These statements suggest that NFT visualization is a key feature that sets Nami apart from other wallets and that some users may have chosen Nami specifically for this reason. Additionally, the context states that some users might not explore other wallets or advanced features due to a lack of technical knowledge about the Recovery Phrase, which could indicate that these users may be less interested in other wallet features and more focused on NFT visualization. However, the context does not provide specific data or percentages to quantify the exact proportion of users who use Nami primarily for NFT visualization."

NFT viewership and smart contract interactions
I don't really like that it is just a browser extension

it's not a dedicated app, it's only a browser extension
3
Access to sundae Swap
It is much less user friendly
3
dapp compatibility
Browser wallet + compatible with dapps
3
Doesn't make my high spec laptop and PC run at full fan speed when it's open. Better token and NFT management.
See aforementioned answer.

3
browser based
no way to delegate to stake pools easily besides their Berry pool
3
Holding multiple asset types for DEX trading. Integration with web browser.
Its fine.

bored","What are the key strengths and weaknesses of the Nami wallet, as indicated by user feedback and scores in a 2021 survey?","The Nami wallet received high scores for ease of use and accessibility, performance and speed, smart contract and dApp integration, NFT support and visualization, and versatility and features. Users praised the user-friendly interface, simple and quick setup, browser extension, and no need for synchronization. They also appreciated the fast transactions, instant access, and efficient operation without delays. The wallet's comprehensive support for smart contracts, seamless dApp connectivity, and browser integration for web3 experiences were also highlighted. Users found the robust NFT gallery, easy NFT management, and integration with Cardano NFT marketplaces to be strong points. The wallet's multiple accounts, testnet support, and diverse functionalities like token and NFT viewing were also appreciated.
        
        However, some users expressed concerns over reliability and security, with scores 3 and below. They mentioned reliability and security concerns, feature limitations, performance issues, and user experience as weaknesses. Users called for UI improvements, more intuitive navigation, and additional features to match or exceed competitors. Some users also expressed a desire for further enhancements in integration with more platforms or improved browser support."

The campaign aims to acquire new users and increase the number of new and restored wallets by highlighting the feature's ability to increase WAU who use the multi-wallet/account.

        The target market for this campaign is the Cardano community who uses multi-wallets and multi-accounts in other Cardano wallets. The campaign assets include a blog post, tweet, twitter banner, email, newsletter, website changes, FAQs, teaser content, paid advertising, webinar, and media/PR.

        The budget for this campaign is allocated as follows:

        Webinar | $20,000
        Media/PR | $30,000

        The budget for the creative asset will be used for the production of the campaign assets, including the blog post, tweet, twitter banner, email, newsletter, website changes, FAQs, and teaser content. The budget for paid advertising will be used to promote the campaign on Twitter, and the budget for the webinar will be used to host a live event to showcase the new feature.

The campaign roadmap and deliverables are designed to help the team stay on track and achieve these goals."
"Who provided feedback
Lace Keepers (power users) in Lace Discord channel
When was the feedback given
20 Feb 2024
Feedback
Rodolpho Ribeiro
presented the
mock-up files
kindly provided by
Daniel Smith
to the Lace Keepers on 16 February 2024. Here's their much-appreciated feedback:
Recovering the wallet as it will be implemented looks much better than it is now. For me, it is important to be able to paste all 24 words of the recovery phrase once, not to paste each word individually in its position
An important feature for me is also
the option to lock specific wallets
(ask for the spending password or another unlock password to be able to unlock them) when you have multiple wallets. Eternl had this feature in a previous version, and now it doesn't have it anymore, and I really miss it. it will probably be implemented in a new version of Eternl, I hope Lace will also implement this
When restoring a wallet from the recovery phrase of when connecting a new hardware wallet, for the multi-account feature,
Lace should ask how many accounts to restore
. An even more advanced option (maybe better for some people) would be to allow selecting individual accounts to restore. Eternl has this feature (I'm not sure if it is also when restoring the wallet or only later, but it has the option anytime to restore new accounts, and allows you to select exactly which account to restore)
If the number of accounts to restore is not specified or not an option, and Lace wants to restore multiple accounts,
it should restore the accounts one by one, until it finds the first one never used
,
then stop searching for new accounts to restore automatically
The functionality to paste the seed phrase should be
resilient to different formats
.
The words could be separated by spaces, tabs, returns, … in the user's password safe or text file. They could be uppercase or lowercase. Seed words are unique after the first four letters, so with some metal seed phrase storages you only give the first four letters
At the screen where users choose a name and a spending password: Maybe, there could be a text stating more explicitly that this is a
local
setting not synchronised across devices, can be chosen freely on every import of the seed phrase, does not provide additional security if an adversary has the seed phrase, … That's a common misconception I observe users having
Account selection should be a grid of checkboxes (for both, hardware and seed phrase wallets) because you can (or at least should be able to) have several accounts under the same wallet. Auto-detection cannot be exhaustive. The standard allows
far
too many accounts (2^31 if I remember correctly). But it should probably try until it finds an unused account and then maybe offer three to five more unused accounts (so that the user can start using more)
The
“Something went wrong” dialogue
when pairing a hardware wallet should give some more details on

went wrong in user-understandable language. “I did not find a USB device at all.”, “I found a Ledger, but it seems to be locked.”, “The Cardano app does not seem to be open.”, “This is a Ledger, but it is not the one belonging to this wallet.”, … This not only helps the user, but also Support because we do not have to give the whole list of possible problems from faulty USB cables to wrong passphrase accounts, but can be much more specific",How can the resiliency of pasting the seed phrase in Lace be improved to accommodate different formats and separators?,"The resiliency of pasting the seed phrase in Lace can be improved to accommodate different formats and separators by making the functionality case-insensitive and able to recognize various separators such as spaces, tabs, and returns. Additionally, the system should be able to identify seed words based on their unique first four letters, which is useful for metal seed phrase storages that only provide the first four letters. This will ensure that users can paste their seed phrases in different formats without encountering issues."
"Following the
strategic partnership between IOG and Blockfrost
, there’s high level direction to consolidate engineering efforts around a single, in-house, data access product and discontinue what can arguably be seen as competing custom solutions. In order to assess the viability of this strategy, this study will explore:
Lace’s current data requirements.
What has been planned to achieve then required level of scale and efficiency, particularly as it relates to decoupling completely from
cardano-db-sync
.
Other scenarios, including Lace as the UI for a full node desktop application.
A gap analysis with the current Blockfrost API
Potential solutions for closing the gaps, utilising the technology built to deliver the current Lace backend.
Lace initially used Blockfrost for the early of the software development, as a strategy for decoupling the front-end development stream. This achieved the goal but the data requirements were mismatched with the API, and therefore low performance and client-side complexity was experienced.
1. Lace’s current data requirements
The data requirements are broken into 8 interfaces, bounded by expected feasibility for a given source to satisfy each property. Each interface implements a base
Provider
interface
note
These interfaces were developed in the scope of the
cardano-js-sdk
, in an attempt to standardise data access at a more general level. Over time it has become apparent this is influenced by the wallet’s requirements, and is better considered part of the Lace code repository. Code will soon be migrated and potentially refactored, so the provider scoping will not be the focus of this study.

5. Potential Solutions for closing the gaps","""How can the data requirements of Lace's eight interfaces be satisfied by the Blockfrost API, considering the gaps identified in the provider type methods and potential solutions for closing them?""","To satisfy Lace's eight interfaces' data requirements using the Blockfrost API, the following solutions can be implemented to close the identified gaps:

        1. AssetProvider:
        - The Blockfrost API does not have an equivalent method for getting assets information in bulk. However, multiple API calls can be made to the `/asset/{asset}` endpoint to retrieve information on each asset individually.
        - To improve performance, consider implementing caching for fetched asset information.
        
        2. ChainHistoryProvider:
        - The `transactionsByAddresses` method can be satisfied by using the `/addresses/{address}/transactions` endpoint.
        - The `transactionsByHashes` method can be satisfied by using the `/txs/{tx_hash}` endpoint.
        - The `blocksByHashes` method can be satisfied by using the `/blocks/{block_hash}` endpoint.

        3. HandleProvider:
        - The `resolveHandles` method can be satisfied by using the `/addresses/{address}/stake_pools` endpoint to resolve handles to stake pools.
        - The `getPolicyIds` method is not directly supported by the Blockfrost API. However, policy IDs can be extracted from the `/assets` endpoint.

        4. NetworkInfoProvider:
        - The `ledgerTip` method can be satisfied by using the `/epochs` endpoint to retrieve the current epoch and slot information.
        - The `protocolParameters` method can be satisfied by using the `/protocol-parameters` endpoint.
        - The `genesisParameters` method can be satisfied by using the `/genesis` endpoint.
        - The `lovelaceSupply` method can be satisfied by using the `/supply` endpoint.
        - The `stake` method can be satisfied by using the `/stake-distribution` endpoint.
        - The `eraSummaries` method can be satisfied by using the `/eras` endpoint.

        5. RewardsProvider:
        - The `rewardsHistory` method can be satisfied by using the `/rewards/{address}` endpoint.
        - The `rewardAccountBalance` method can be satisfied by using the `/addresses/{address}/balance` endpoint.

        By implementing these solutions, Lace's eight interfaces can satisfy their data requirements using the Blockfrost API, considering the gaps identified in the provider type methods."

"Epic, Stories and Tasks Management Guidelines
This guideline outlines our approach to managing epics, user stories and tasks, emphasizing the distinction between product requirements and technical tasks. It serves as a guide for product teams and engineers to streamline the development process, ensuring that each user story is tied to a specific functionality, with well defined acceptance criteria that are understandable from a business standpoint, creating alignment between product goals and technical execution.
Initiative-Jira (or single Epic feature)
Initiatives
should clearly define:
Executive summary
Affected products & areas
Target audience
Problem being solved
High-level scope with delivery phases
Each phase has a delivery of value
Risks and dependencies
Risks may be defined at the top level of the initiative or associated to a phase
Expected measurable business outcomes
This information should completely align with the
Definition of Done (DoD) document
, or just reference it
Epic
Each epic must have a clear scope
, that ties to a DoD phase (summarized in the initiative/DoD) and identifiable through the titles of user stories contained
For only-technical work, epics must still contain a summary, problem being solved, high-level scope, and expected outcomes from a developer or infrastructure POV
For maintenance or production
bugs there are generic epics that act as buckets of other tasks that don’t belong to the standard product development
All user-facing functionalities should be captured in user stories
Minor adjustments, such as updating copy or changing styles, may be filed as tasks
The rest of the development work required to achieve the functional requirements defined by the stories, must be filed as tasks which are part of the epic, and which are linked by a
required
dependency to the relevant story
User Story and Required Tasks
User stories capture the functional requirements of a feature. They are directly tied to a user facing functionality and include well-defined acceptance criteria that are understandable from a business perspective
Engineering tasks required to accomplish the story may be optionally created by and for engineers, containing all technical information necessary. This approach provides the engineering team with the flexibility to create tasks optimally, without affecting overall project management. These tasks are always linked to the story they fulfill, being part of the same epic
Benefits:
Easy identification of the epic scope
Clear separation between product requirements (user stories) and technical tasks (tasks)
Enables the possibility to monitoring real progress towards feature release by tracking stories
User Story Structure
Background (optional): Provides context for the story.  If the reasoning is clearly inherited from the epic, it may be omitted
Scope: Describes the core functionality with the format:
""As a [persona],
I want to [action],
so that [outcome].""
Out of Scope (optional): Clearly states what is not included in the story's scope
Platforms:
Specifies the platforms to be addressed (e.g., mobile, desktop)
A refinement session is held once the first definition is ready, and before UI designs are available. Product, Design,
Development
, and QA teams meet to ensure the scope and goals of the story are understood
Extra development tasks required for completing the story are identified, created and linked to the main story, following their own refinement processes within the Engineering team
Acceptance Criteria (AC)
The AC serves as a checklist for QA to verify that a story meets all requirements before it is merged. It is a contract between Product and Engineering teams.
AC statement are defined by the Product team, and any modification or removal on the ticket must be done by the PM/PO
When there are UI designs involved, AC points should be defined/finalized after the designs are ready
Requirements:
Must define all functional points as minimum requirements
Use scenario-based checklists to cover various conditions
Statements should follow the
""Given, When, Then""
format, using abbreviations when needed “
When.., Then..”,
these abbreviations carry the context from the first full statement
When there are many statements sharing the core part of the statement, it’s recommended to highlight (in bold for example) the difference between the statements for QA readability
Process:
After defining the AC, a refinement session is held for final approval. Once approved, the story is ready for execution
R
elease Management
User stories and bugs are assigned a
fixVersion
by the PM/PO for planning purposes, and may be updated as needed depending on priorities and scope changes

For maintenance or production bugs, there are generic epics that act as buckets of other tasks that don’t belong to the standard product development. All user-facing functionalities should be captured in user stories, while minor adjustments may be filed as tasks. The rest of the development work required to achieve the functional requirements defined by the stories should be filed as tasks which are part of the epic and linked by a required dependency to the relevant story. User stories capture the functional requirements of a feature and are directly tied to a user-facing functionality with well-defined acceptance criteria that are understandable from a business perspective. Engineering tasks required to accomplish the story may be optionally created by and for engineers, containing all technical information necessary. These tasks are always linked to the story they fulfill, being part of the same epic."

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary (overall project)
This project lays the foundation for efficient development of critical Lace projects, which includes extending the product over multiple platforms (extension, mobile, desktop) and blockchains (Cardano, Midnight, Bitcoin and Ethereum).
Application Architecture
In order to address the multi-chain/multi-platform development, Lace codebase requires significant restructuring, refactoring, and in some areas, a complete redesign. Without this effort, development will be constrained to the current implementation, highly inefficient and tech-debt prone, getting to a point in the mid term in which our development may significantly stall due to the lack of proper extensibility.
We have already put significant effort into designing Lace Mobile, learning from the pain points of Lace Browser Extension development. It is suitable for supporting multiple platforms that utilize a common set of application features, but we must update the architecture to include the browser extension targets and multi-chain abstractions.
Technical Debt
Lace has significant technical debt. Given heavy focus on functional/feature development, the debt will accumulate, impacting quality and slowing us down. Therefore, this type of refactor/re-architecture is inevitable, so it’s best to do it sooner rather than later.
Engineering Processes & Procedures
Utilizing the work that already went into Lace Mobile is a great starting point. However, in order to support efficient full-scale/tribe-wide development, we must re-evaluate and define engineering processes, procedures, and guidelines for the contributors.
Release Processes & Automation
We’re also in a poor situation with deployments and release agility, so taking a step back and establishing our desired outcomes, then working from a clean slate to achieve them will give us a major quality and productivity boost.
cardano-js-sdk
Lace backend applications, as well as some of the Lace-centric front-end functionality currently reside in cardano-js-sdk repository. This creates friction with the isolated SDLC, as well as unnecessary challenges for deployment automation. Hoisting Lace-centric packages into a Lace repository will allow us to work more efficiently.
Risks/Concerns (overall project)
Underestimate
Re-architecture effort is difficult to estimate and may be larger than expected. This might result in:
Delaying critical projects, such as Midnight Glacier Drop.
Taking shortcuts and introducing technical debt early on in the project, which would take away some of the justification for doing it.
Mitigation
Plan B for critical projects:
Midnight POC integration into existing Lace codebase.
Bringing in a dedicated architect would take away some workload from engineering.
Feature Freeze / Maintenance-mode Period
We’ll have to put a lot of resources into migrating existing Lace functionality until we achieve feature parity. Working on new features in the original codebase will delay feature parity, increasing the
Underestimate
risk described above.
Mitigation

Full Midnight integration
Complete Lace Mobile application
New Lace features
Phases
Phase 1: Design, Validate & Estimate
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase
In order to mitigate Feature Freeze / Maintenance-mode Period risk, we must establish the architecture and engineering processes/procedures before we begin full-scale feature migration. This will allow us to:
Ensure feature migration is as efficient as possible
Estimate Phase 2: Migrate and plan based on it. We might decide to not freeze some critical projects and instead accept the cost of implementing some aspects twice.
Scope for this phase
Re-evaluate/refine architecture for multiple platforms, blockchains and potentially applications (Nami)
Re-purpose and upgrade lace-mobile repository
Enforce Conventional Commits via GitHub workflow
Upgrade dependencies
Produce engineering documentation
Rework existing Lace Mobile documentation to position the mobile product as just one application
“Getting Started” guide for engineers, documenting how to map old patterns into the new ones
Conventional Commits training material
CI checks for the browser extension (smoke tests)
SPIKE and setup multi-platform UI toolkit
Migrate application-specific cardano-js-sdk code
Common
Finalize any open PRs relating to the code we’re about to move
Review the dependency tree, possibly hoist some utils to remove dependencies where we can
The provider interfaces
e2e tests
Local network caching to remove dead 25 mins of setup, maybe with S3 now it’s higher perf.
These will be considered integration tests in the context of Lace
Backend
Migrate cardano-services and provider-specific projections from the SDK repo into
xsy-wallet
as backend
Switch lace-ops to use this as the source, which should be a drop-in replacement
Setup continuous deployment for all dev environments, using branch merge as the trigger
Full local development environment with any network (incl. local network) removing the strict dependency on public testnets.
Frontend
wallet, web-extension packages
(optional) consider hoisting dapp-connector, key-management, tx-construction packages
Publish packages under @lace , or @xsywallet, namespace for consumption in the existing Lace codebase during the transition
Define engineering SOPs
All members part of lace-activity Slack channel, user account associated with GitHub account
In context PR discussion happens in this channel using the threads created by the bot (not in squad channels)
POCs to test the architecture, engineering processes/procedures and optimize where we can:
Onboarding functionality (restore wallet only) into multiple targets (extension, mobile, CLI & (maybe) Nami)
Including relevant e2e tests from Lace extension
Multi-chain onboarding (Midnight) in the extension. Under the feature flag.
Out of Scope for this phase
CD for front-end applications (extension/mobile)
Changes to the SDK code to improve the modeling once it’s part of Lace.

        1. Identify the root cause of the bottlenecks and inefficient delivery of value in the Yellow ticket process. This could involve analyzing data, interviewing stakeholders, and reviewing documentation.

        2. Develop a plan to address the identified issues, including specific actions, timelines, and responsible parties. The plan should aim to streamline the Yellow ticket process, reduce bottlenecks, and improve the delivery of value.

        3. Implement the plan, closely monitoring progress and making adjustments as necessary. The sub-group should work collaboratively with other teams and stakeholders to ensure the successful implementation of the plan.

        4. Establish metrics to measure the success of the improvement actions, and regularly review these metrics to assess progress. This will help the sub-group determine whether the actions are having the desired impact and identify areas for further improvement.

        5. Document the improvement actions and share them with relevant stakeholders. This will help ensure that everyone involved in the Yellow ticket process is aware of the changes and can adjust their work accordingly.

        6. Continuously review and improve the Yellow ticket process, incorporating feedback from stakeholders and monitoring for any new issues that arise. This will help prevent future recurrences of the bottlenecks and inefficient delivery of value.

        7. Communicate regularly with stakeholders, keeping them informed of progress and soliciting feedback. This will help build trust and ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals.

        8. Consider implementing additional training or support for team members involved in the Yellow ticket process, to help them understand the changes and perform their roles effectively.

        9. Explore the possibility of automating certain aspects of the Yellow ticket process, to further streamline the process and reduce the potential for human error.

        10. Establish a culture of continuous improvement, encouraging team members to identify and address issues as they arise, and providing the necessary support and resources to do so."

Every week there will be new chapters to review that will be reviewed
Content of the arch repo is mostly up to date. Native tokens are up to date
Unshielded spec still not available (final)
There is not timeline yet for unshielded in testnet
Action Points
Mauricio to share Glacier drop new document with Lace, this should touch on the UX
Mauricio to confirm drop wallet requirements next week
Abel to schedule a meeting next week (Tuesday) to review the UX for shielded ledger
Next week the first documentation chapter chunk will be shared, Lace will review and provide feedback the following week
Feb 29
Participants
Midnight: Andrzej, Agron, Abel, Mauricio
Lace: Piotr, Ian, Brandon, Fernando
Notes
Glacier drop to start on July, and for Lace is not a requirement to support Midnight, since the drop happens on Cardano
UX for glacier drop in progress on Midnight side, the current thesis is that Eth/Btc maxis won’t bring their keys to other wallet
There should be some results next week
Right now no timeline for documentation. Timeline will be provided next Thur.
Midnight is aiming to provide something like
https://docs.sui.io/
Piotr to send Andrzej github handles to provide access to private repos
There are architecture documents within the repo which could be the first step for Lace to understand scope
The idea is to have a collaboration dynamics where Midnight provide resources and Lace provides feedback on them, till matching expectations
Lace is the beta wallet partner for Midnight, and the goal is to build enough documentation so next wallet has an easy and comprehensive path
Action Points
Abel to:
Schedule a weekly starting next Thu. And for next week:
Provide timeline on documentation
Check/sync on existing repo documentation
Touchbase on glacier drop or other relevant dates
Schedule UX meeting
Piotr to give github handles to Andrzej","What is the current status of Lace's support for the Glacier Drop and its associated requirements, and when can solid confirmation be expected?","The current status of Lace's support for the Glacier Drop and its associated requirements is that Lace already supports the requirements, but solid confirmation is expected next week."

Introducing XSY (pronounced ‘eksy’). XSY’s mission is to create capital efficient systems that don’t encumber more assets in collateral than they unlock in value. Welcome to the future of blockchain economies.
In the dynamic world of blockchain, the true essence of economic growth and innovation lies not just in the creation of digital assets but in the strategic acceleration of economic activity. Historically, the approach to blockchain ecosystem development has been akin to the ""Field of Dreams"" - build it and they will come. However, at XSY, we believe in a more nuanced, systemic approach to stimulate economic activity and ensure more predictable outcomes through comprehensive partnerships and capabilities.
The blockchain industry faces a significant challenge: the absence of consistent, universally accepted metrics to assess and understand the economic health and underlying value of blockchain ecosystems. This gap has led to a reliance on inconsistent indicators, fostering a ""number go up, project is good"" mentality that fails to capture the complex realities of these ecosystems.
In response, XSY is committed to redefining value creation in the blockchain space by developing consistent measurements akin to those in traditional financial markets. Our aim is to foster a deeper understanding of blockchain systems and their intrinsic value, ensuring a more stable and inclusive financial future.
Join us on this exciting journey as we work to unlock new possibilities and create a more accessible, efficient, and stable economic future.

Summary
On
29 Feb 2024
, Thursday, X user
@banjoTheGamer
reported
the apparent loss of funds when using Nami to send Ada to an exchange, instead unintentionally jpegstore.io being sent to another address, in a transaction where he did not use Ada handles.
Banjo’s tweet thread led to the creation of an incident crisis management. Immediately the Lace/Nami team started to investigate possible causes for the issue. By the evening the team had found a few hypotheses and started working on a fix.
On
01 Mar 2024
, Friday, the whole team discussed and reviewed the fix. The crisis committee decided to wait until Monday for a decision.
On
02 Mar 2024
, Saturday,
multiple tweets were being made
reporting losses on Nami when using Ada Handle. Live spaces were created, and the community began to converge on the same conclusion regarding the cause.
Due to the lack of SDETs and QAs available for proper testing, the crisis committee decided to release an
emergency fix
that temporarily
disabled Ada Handle
.
On
04 Mar 2024
and
05 Mar 2024
the team worked on a proper fix and sent it to Charles Morgan to audit it
Impact
Some users suffered loss of funds either due to sending to a script address (without a datum), or the recipient is not an address they do not own.

Root Cause Analysis
Why did the funds get sent to the wrong address?
The UI was not displaying the mismatch between resolved address
Why was there a mismatch in the UI?
How did this impact the initial user if they didn’t “send” to an Ada Handle?
Corrective Action Plan
Disable the Ada Handle integration and ship a version to limit the impact","What was the role of the Ada Handle integration in causing the user's funds to be sent to the wrong address, and how did disabling this integration limit the impact of the issue?","The Ada Handle integration was the root cause of the user's funds being sent to the wrong address. The integration was not properly displaying the resolved address in the UI, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual addresses. This mismatch caused the user to unintentionally send their funds to jpegstore.io instead of the intended exchange.
        
        Disabling the Ada Handle integration limited the impact of the issue by preventing further users from experiencing the same problem. By temporarily disabling the integration, the team was able to prevent any new instances of funds being sent to the wrong address due to the UI mismatch. This allowed the team to work on a proper fix and audit it before re-enabling the integration, ensuring that the issue would not recur in the future."

Amazing but can you explain like I’m 5 ? I don’t understand what this is…
What is this Built on
Concern 2: Criticism of Marketing Language
Some users criticized the use of marketing language in the XSY announcement, expressing a preference for more straightforward and technical explanations.
""@wsford @xsy_fi @IOHKMedia @IOHK_Charles @InputOutputHK sounds like a lot of marketing gibberish to be honest""
""Wow, appreciate this explanation. I didn't get that from the post. Honestly the enterprise marketing terms just blur the lines of what is being built and remove my excitement. Maybe it's just me, but I'm genuinely massively excited about this kind of development, ""","What improvements can be made to the clarity and marketing language of XSY project communications, based on user feedback and sentiment analysis following the soft launch?","To improve the clarity and marketing language of XSY project communications, the following steps can be taken:

1. Provide simpler explanations: Users have expressed confusion and a lack of understanding regarding the XSY venture. To address this, communications should include simpler explanations of the project and its offerings.

2. Avoid marketing language: Some users have criticized the use of marketing language in the XSY announcement. To address this, communications should use more straightforward and technical explanations, avoiding enterprise marketing terms that may blur the lines of what is being built and remove excitement.

3. Engage with users: Users have expressed a desire for more information and engagement from the XSY project. To address this, communications should include opportunities for users to ask questions and provide feedback, as well as regular updates on the project's progress.

4. Use visual aids: To help users understand the XSY venture and its offerings, communications should include visual aids such as diagrams, charts, and infographics.

5. Provide clear calls to action: Users have expressed interest in learning more about the XSY venture and its offerings. To address this, communications should include clear calls to action, such as links to the XSY website and other resources.

By taking these steps, the XSY project can improve the clarity and marketing language of its communications, addressing user feedback and sentiment analysis following the soft launch."
"Background
Came out of this meeting:
https://input-output.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CWT/pages/4163141643/2024-02-21+Yellow+Deployment+Retro#Next-Steps
Attendees
Berno, Gytis, Michal, Daniele, Piotr, Martynas, Tomas, Jon
Jon’s Notes
Gytis
move deployment code to a new B/E code repo
automate deployments with CI
Piotr
Cardano JS SDK code will *also* need to be moved to this new B/E repo
Daniele
let's focus on creating a CD process first
moving client side code is a *subsequent* step
Gytis
it's mostly a monolithic B/E right now, so moving *this* would make a big difference
Daniele
let's talk ENVIRONMENTS
we need a CI flow on pushing a commit to deploy on DEV envs, ie Continuous Deployment
we need a button to deploy with version number considered stable on LIVE envs
Gytis
for dev-preview....
for dev-preprod we should indeed have Continuous Deployment
Michal
if dev-preview is currently automatic, why do we have to move code to make dev-preview work?
Piotr
we have a change, we merge it, CD automatically deploys to preprod
at the same time there's a PR executing E2E tests on the same prepod env
if there's a failure, we don't know what caused it
Gytis
let's have *shared* dev-preprod (non-continuously deployed from Master via button clicks in Github)
LIVE envs are *always* deployed via button clicks, for safety
we create ad hocs envs on button click for merge requests (these are extra work for SRE)
dev-preprod *is* the QA env
Daniele
we should have continuous deployment in dev-.... , dev-....., dev-....
as well you need a stable QA env where you can run 48hrs of tests
always before I've had i) Dev ii) QA iii) Prod envs
Berno
dev-preview already has continuous deployment (ie automatically, on commit)
dev-preprod would be continuous delivery, ie a human button-click required (because eg QA might be happening there, it's shared)
LIVE is also button click but with fewer authorised clickers
Daniele
we should have continuous deployment on dev-preprod too, this should *not* be ""our QA env""
we need continuous deployment on 3 networks (1. dev-preview 2. dev-preprod 3. Mainnet), cos they all have different data. I need to see immediately the effect of my changes on Mainnet.
we do not use ""preprod"" because we have a NETWORK called ""preprod""
the usual names are Dev, QA/PreProd, Production
we need a matrix of NETWORK x ENVIRONMENT (env-nets? net-envs?)
dev-preview
dev-preprod
dev-mainnet
qa-preview
qa-preprod
qa-mainnet
live-preview
live-preprod
live-mainnet
purpose of live-preprod is to let the dev debug
purpose of qa-preprod is to run (potentially lengthy) tests
Berno
we would need to construct a business case for the costs here
lower envs can have slower (cheaper) disks
why not just shut things down when not in use? Cos nodes that take a week to sync are on the expensive disks :-(
Gytis
## Stage 1 Option 1 (Could be implemented easily within a week)
dev-preview - continuously deployed from `master`
dev-preprod - deployed with manual CI execution
dev-mainnet - deployed with manual CI execution
<no extra infra cost>
### Stage 1 Option 2:
continuous-preview - continuously deployed from `master`
continuous-preprod - continuously deployed from `master`
dev-preview - deployed with manual CI execution
dev-preprod - deployed with manual CI execution
dev-mainnet - deployed with manual CI execution
<extra cost but not much, these are cheap, except for mainnet, which is why it's not duplicated>
# Stage 2 (Some extra time is required after stage 1)
Environments created with CI for dev-{preview,preprod} and possibly partial for dev-mainnet
Daniele
I'm running a full Cardano stack on my own hardware, 2-yr-old $5K machine
do we really need to spend much on dev envs?
Berno
it's concurrent reads on Mainnet that's the problem with AWS
you need SSD reading speeds and that's very expensive, it's a cloud scam!
Gytis
ad-hoc envs for Mainnet? Way cheaper to send QAs to their own machine, this will pay off in 2 months
Gytis
Step 0
Give infra team a green flag to merge deployments code to XYZ repo (ie doing for dev-preprod what we already do for dev-preview)
***Martynas gave this green flag in the meeting, and Jon considers that this is sufficient authority***
Ticket 1
dev-preprod: Move deployments code to XYZ repo
Ticket 2
dev-preprod: Add deployments CI/CD
Ticket 3
dev-mainnet: Move deployments code to XYZ repo
Ticket 4
dev-mainnet: Add deployments CI/CD

Next steps
Logging:
when we look at the logs in Grafana it’s not always easy to find a specific env, the first page of logs is 90% useless & you have to click a lot
some info in each log line is hard to parse, eg json, needs pasting into decoding tools to read them properly
Can solve some of this with knowledge-sharing? see

        - The deployment code should be moved to a new backend code repository.
        - The Cardano JS SDK code will also need to be moved to this new backend repository.
        - Continuous Integration (CI) should be used to automate deployments.
        - A Continuous Deployment (CD) process should be created first, focusing on deploying to development environments when a commit is pushed.
        - A button should be created to deploy with a version number considered stable to live environments.
        - Dev-preview environments should have Continuous Deployment, while dev-preprod environments should have a button to deploy with a version number considered stable.
        - Ad hoc environments should be created on button click for merge requests.
        - The usual environment names should be Dev, QA/PreProd, and Production.
        - A matrix of network x environment should be created, with three networks (dev-preview, dev-preprod, and Mainnet) and three environments (dev, QA/PreProd, and live) for a total of nine environments.
        - The infra team should be given a green flag to merge deployment code to the XYZ repository.
        - Tickets should be created for moving deployments code to the XYZ repository, adding deployments CI/CD, and refactoring deployments code and CI/CD for dev-preview, dev-preprod, and dev-mainnet.
        - Michal should be integrated into this process.
        - The PR(s) should be approved by the appropriate team members.
        - The lace-ops code should be copied, not the dev-preview code.
        - Logging issues should be addressed by improving the readability of log lines and providing better tools for parsing and decoding logs.
        - Checkboxes should be added to all pipelines to deploy from a PR.
        - The deployment of live envs should be discussed in the future."

A deeper dive into Blockchain trends (Chat GPT-4)
For the period between 1st March 2024 and 13th March 2024, two key trends in the blockchain industry have been identified:
Growth of DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
:
The blockchain sector continues to see robust growth, especially within the DeFi segment. This trend highlights a sustained interest and increasing investments in blockchain technologies within the financial sector.
Analysts and industry research underscore the financial sector's strong inclination towards adopting blockchain for its promise of enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency in financial transactions .
Key Trends in Crypto and Web3 Developments
: Binance Research's analysis of the ecosystem in early March 2024 provides insights into the significant Web3 developments observed in February 2024. This encompasses a broad spectrum of advancements in the blockchain space, indicating a dynamic and evolving landscape.
The focus has likely been on how blockchain technologies facilitate new forms of online interactions, financial transactions, and decentralized applications (dApps)
.
These trends reflect the blockchain industry's ongoing evolution and its increasing integration into the broader digital economy. The emphasis on DeFi suggests a continued disruption of traditional financial systems, while the focus on Web3 developments points to the blockchain's role in paving the way for a decentralized internet.
A deeper dive into crypto wallets:
In the timeframe from 1st March 2024 to 13th March 2024, the focus within the crypto wallet space has been on enhancing security and user experience. Insights derived from the latest research and analysis indicate a couple of key developments:
Security Enhancements
: There has been a
significant emphasis on improving the security mechanisms of crypto wallets
. This includes the integration of multi-factor authentication, biometric security features, and advanced encryption techniques to safeguard users' assets against the increasing threat of cyber-attacks and unauthorized access .
User Experience (UX) Improvements
: Efforts to streamline the user experience have been apparent,
with wallet providers focusing on making crypto transactions more intuitive and accessible to a broader audience.
This includes simplifying the wallet interface, improving transaction speed, and providing more educational resources to help new users navigate the crypto space more effectively .
These developments suggest that the industry is responding to the growing demand for more secure and user-friendly crypto storage solutions. As the crypto market continues to mature, these trends are likely to continue, driving innovation in the wallet space and potentially leading to wider adoption of cryptocurrencies as a whole.

However, the context provides the monthly unique users (avg) for Nami, which is 32,477. Assuming that the monthly unique users represent the number of active users in a month, we can calculate the churn rate for Nami using the formula:
        (Number of unique users in the previous month - Number of unique users in the current month) / Number of unique users in the previous month
        Unfortunately, the context does not provide the number of unique users for the N month and the (N-1) month, so we cannot calculate the churn rate for Nami.
        Regarding the ratio of usage based on lifetime installs and daily active users, the Lace wallet has a ratio of 2.9%, while the Nami wallet has a ratio of 1.2%. This means that for every 100 lifetime installs, Lace has 2.9 daily active users, while Nami has 1.2 daily active users. Therefore, the Lace wallet has a higher ratio of usage based on lifetime installs and daily active users compared to the Nami wallet."

The
unique users, as well as the SEO generated users have dropped since our organic content is inexistent for this month;
We notice a spike in unique users on 2nd February (208), followed by 19th February (191). I can’t identify any events to correlate with these occurrences. These website visitors seem to be ‘new’.
This month, new (1,834) versus returning (121) are both in a slight decrease;
The best referring domain is direct, followed by Google, and Nami website;
Lace.io
website visitors prefer our homepage, then the features page, and FAQs;
The
most successful campaign is the Nami banner on our homepage,
and the most successful content is still the Nami acquisition blog post on

Conclusion:
Data from the
Google Store dashboard
is not updated since 3rd February, hence it looks like Lace only had
122 installs and 59 uninstalls
, resulting in a
churn rate of 48.36%; This data is not accurate as it’s missing most of the month;
From PostHog analytics we can identify a spike in the daily active users (DAU) on 15th February - 752; The average of DAU is 139.86;
Weekly active users averages at 1,742 users;
The number of unique users is still not clear, since we can see two different numbers in PostHog. One figure is saying 4,056 uniques this month, while the other graph (which also takes into account the country of these unique users) mentions 4,258.
Though February is a shorter month the difference between the previous month and the current is only -2.8%;
The number of sent tokens (including NFTs) has decreased by 28% since the previous month, resulting in 1,078 sent assets;
Overall, Lace seems to have a high amount of dormant users. We need to identify ways to engage these users and transform them into at least resurrecting users. Also, same scenario is revealed from the Cohort analysis;
The highest amount of sent tokens actions is recorded on 29th February, which is when the Nami ADA Handles bug peaked;
This month we registered
158 new wallets
, a 7.6% decrease from the previous month, most being created on 1st and 2nd February,
coinciding with the first Nami incident
;
The number of
connected hardware wallets is 133,
a 15% increase since January. 7th Feb is the day most HW were connected;
385 restored wallets in February
, an increase of 4.62% from the previous month, most being restored on 20th February;
The onboarding process for a
new wallet
shows that the highest drop off is registered when users are asked to insert their first batch of the recovery phrase, followed by when they are asked to set up a wallet password:
327 people who started the onboarding process
11 dropped off, 3316 continued to set up their ‘wallet name’
21 people dropped off, 295 continued to set up their ‘wallet password’
3 people dropped off, 292 continued to the recovery phrase intro screen
13 persons dropped off, 279 continued to write down the first batch of their recovery phrase
2 people dropped off, 277 continued to write down the second batch of their recovery phrase
2 persons dropped off, 275 continued to write down the third batch of their recovery phrase
28 people dropped off, 247 continued to insert the first batch of their recovery phrase
2 persons dropped off, 245 continued to insert the second batch of their recovery phrase
4 persons dropped off, 241 continued to insert the third batch of their recovery phrase and completed the onboarding process
86 people did not open their wallet straight away
The number of sent tokens decreased by 48%
compared to the previous month - 1,459 actions currently vs 2,820 previously
From the
daily active users (DAU) the most active days were 3rd, 10th, 25th;

19,372","""What factors may have contributed to the spike in unique website visitors on February 2nd and 19th, as well as the decrease in new and returning users this month, based on the website metrics provided?""","The spike in unique website visitors on February 2nd and 19th could be due to various factors such as targeted marketing campaigns, social media promotions, or partnerships with other websites. However, without specific information about any events or campaigns that coincided with these dates, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.

The decrease in new and returning users this month could be attributed to the lack of organic content on the website, as mentioned in the disclaimer. This could have resulted in fewer users discovering the website through search engines, leading to a drop in unique users and organic users. Additionally, the fact that the data was not captured during 25-27th February and the Google Store dashboard only captured data for the first 3 days of February could also have contributed to the decrease in unique users and installs.

Furthermore, the high amount of dormant users and the decrease in the number of sent tokens could indicate that users are not actively engaging with the website or the product. This could be due to a lack of user-friendly features, unclear instructions, or a confusing user interface. It is important to identify ways to engage these users and transform them into active users.

Lastly, the onboarding process for a new wallet shows that the highest drop off is registered when users are asked to insert their first batch of the recovery phrase and set up a wallet password. This could indicate that the process is too complicated or time-consuming for users, leading to a high drop-off rate. Simplifying the onboarding process and providing clear instructions could help retain more users and increase engagement."
"Pre DoD work
Product Lead drives the presentation of the following data to Sr Management:
elevator pitch
the source of the idea/request
the results of any Product Discovery that has been done
the Success Criteria that will be measure to prove the Outcomes have been achieved
a statement of ‘Hypothesis Confidence’ (ie how sure are you, that if we build the thing in the elevator pitch, those Success Criteria
will
be achieved)
Writing the DoD #1 - Exec Summary
The pre-DoD steps should already have provided information for the Exec Summary
Writing the DoD #2 - Overall Project
Product Lead drives the creation of high-level scope
of the overall project
(including what is
out
of scope). This should explain:
what user personas are involved
what changes each user personas will experience
how these changes will lead to achieving the Success Criteria
Tech Lead reviews; when happy, they add (similarly high-level) implementation steps
Size estimate: at this stage the only size estimate that can be supplied is probably a crude t-shirt sizing (and/or you may wish to run some Spike(s) to reduce uncertainty)
Depending on the project, this
may
be the point to present back to Sr Management for feedback
Writing the DoD #3 - Phases
For anything other than small projects, the project is broken down into smaller phases.
This is to avoid the Waterfall anti-pattern of “you don’t even
plan
to get any value until you’ve finished the
entire
thing, and often that value turns out to be zero, so you’ve wasted all the effort”. Instead you should be trying to deliver value incrementally as you go.
This phasing also gives the opportunity to decision-makers to cut scope: “you know what? We’re gonna stop at phase 3, we might return to phase 4 later, phase 5 I don’t think we’re
ever

For each phase
, take the process above for the overall scope and apply it iteratively to each phase, such that you end up with the following for each phase:
agreed scope
user personas affected
the changes each persona will experience
how these changes will lead to achieving which Success Criteria
the ideal is that
every phase produces measurable achievement of at least some of the project’s overall Success Criteria
if a phase is a pure technical enabler or PoC, then the DoD should state
what this phase now enables
: a possible format is
After phase XX, as a .., I will be able to …
Tech Lead reviews; when happy, they add implementation steps for each phase
Size estimate: at this stage the only size estimate that can be supplied is probably a crude t-shirt sizing (and/or you may wish to run some Spike(s) to reduce uncertainty)
Depending on the project, this
may
be the point to present back to Sr Management for feedback
Getting to a Size Estimate in ‘ticket counts’
So in some temporary document (Miro? GDocs? Confluence? Spreadsheet?) write down:
the Story Tickets, in proposed
order of delivery
the enabling Task tickets added
…ending up with a nested list:
Phase 1
Story A
Task A1
Task A2
Task A3
Task A4
Story B
Task B1
Task B2
Phase 2
Story C
Task C1
Task C2
This would give us an Initial Ticket Count (ITC) of:
Phase 1: 8 tickets (2 x Story, 6 x Task)
Phase 2: 3 tickets (1 x Story, 2 x Task)
This then needs to be scaled to give a MAX/MIN for the
completion
of each phase
If you have no better idea about how to do this, use this
Default suggestion
:
add 30% to the ITC for the MIN, triple the ITC for the MAX
This gives:
Phase 1:         MIN 10, MAX 24
Phase 2:         MIN  4, MAX  9
Project overall: MIN 14, MAX 33
Putting this into Jira
How
to map phases into Jira? Map a
project phase
(which is, ideally, an
Independently Releasable Thing That Will Realise Some Value
) onto an
Epic

to create these tickets? Do
not
create all the Epics or their children in Jira up front

4 types of risk
value

the Product Function is chiefly responsible for managing this risk
usability

the Design Function is chiefly responsible for managing this risk
feasibility

many projects/features/products
fail
because they cannot be built within a reasonable timeframe / cost
the Delivery & Engineering functions are chiefly responsible for managing this risk
business viability
risk
many projects/features/products
fail
because they do not have the buy-in / collaboration of other parts of the business (Legal, Sales, Support etc)
the Product Function is chiefly responsible for managing this risk","How should a Product Lead and Tech Lead collaborate to break down a project into phases with agreed scope, user personas, changes per persona, and success criteria, while also estimating size and managing risks?","A Product Lead and Tech Lead should collaborate to break down a project into phases by first creating a high-level scope of the overall project, including what is out of scope and explaining what user personas are involved, what changes each user persona will experience, and how these changes will lead to achieving the success criteria. The Tech Lead should then review and add implementation steps. For each phase, the process should be repeated iteratively to end up with agreed scope, user personas affected, the changes each persona will experience, how these changes will lead to achieving which success criteria, and the ideal is that every phase produces measurable achievement of at least some of the project’s overall success criteria. The Tech Lead should review and add implementation steps for each phase. A size estimate should be supplied for each phase, which can be a crude t-shirt sizing, and Spike(s) may be run to reduce uncertainty. The project should be broken down into smaller phases to avoid the Waterfall anti-pattern and to deliver value incrementally. The Product Lead should manage value risk, the Design Function should manage usability risk, the Delivery & Engineering functions should manage feasibility risk, and the Product Function should manage business viability risk."

Multi-wallet/ multi-account
MVP
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Adding multi-wallet and multi-account support is a table stakes feature, with some users not able to switch to Lace due to our current deficit, and others quickly churning after onboarding
Scope: Multiple wallets
Users can add (create/restore/pair) multiple Cardano wallets
Users can seamlessly switch between different wallets
Users can easily see the current wallet’s name
Users can remove a wallet without affecting the other ones
Scope: Multiple accounts
Users can enable/disable additional accounts on existing wallets
Users can easily see the current account’s name (and where it’s nested)
Users can switch between accounts.

Relative Effort Ratios - a basic algorithm
Let’s assume that “Developer Availability” is the sole constraint to consider (a massive simplification but hey, gives us something to work with)
We want to
saturate
work according to priorities
Let’s say that Squad X has 6 devs. How many projects can it work on, and what’s the Relative Effort Ratio of these projects?
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio 1?”. Let’s say that’s
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio 2?”. Let’s say that’s
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio
3
?”. Let’s say that’s
. But actually there’s only
dev left anyway
This Squad can work on 3 Projects simultaneously, and Relative Effort Ratios between those Projects are as follows:
Project Prio 1:
Project Prio 2:
Project Prio 3:
But wait - we do
not
assume that we
only work on ‘Projects’, there’s always some Non-Project Work to do (production bugs, misc tweaks here & there…).
How do we work
this
out?
Do a Jira Query over the last x months, get all your Resolved Tickets, and categorise them by Epic
Sort those Resolved Tickets into two buckets: 1)
Epics that represent your Prioritised Projects,
2)
Non-Project Work
Let’s imagine that there are
35
tickets in Project Bucket #1,
23
tickets in the Non-Project Bucket #2. This is a
ratio of 60:40
Let’s derive from that data that
60%
of the effort of this Squad goes into Project work, while
40%
goes into Non-Project Work
The overall Relative Effort Ratios for this Squad is therefore:
Project Prio 1:
Project Prio 2:
Project Prio 3:
Non-Project Work:","What is the overall Relative Effort Ratio for a squad with six developers, working on three projects simultaneously while also dedicating 60% of their effort to project work and 40% to non-project work?","The overall Relative Effort Ratios for this Squad is therefore:

"You cannot call a ticket R4D unless you have good answers to these questions:
What’s the entire feature/flow? How does this ticket fit in?
What value does this work deliver? Is there some way to deliver
more
value / deliver value with
less
effort?
How are we gonna test this?
What’s the status of the designs? Is it
ready
? How much is it gonna change?
Do we have all these components in Storybook? If not, what’s the effort to do that?
What data fields do we need? Where does that data come from?
How big is this ticket? Should we split it up? Or just do less work and ship value more incrementally?
Perhaps we should reintroduce a Ticket Estimation process to force this ^^ discussion… and The Thing That Is Estimated will be “all the ACs”","Given the context, a suitable question to ask could be:

""What is the necessary data, design readiness, testing approach, and potential impact of implementing the R4D ticket, and should it be split up or delivered incrementally?""","What is the necessary data, design readiness, testing approach, and potential impact of implementing the R4D ticket, and should it be split up or delivered incrementally?

To answer this question, we would need to consider the following:

1. Data fields: What data fields does the R4D ticket require, and where does that data come from? Ensuring that the necessary data is available and accessible is crucial for the successful implementation of the ticket.
2. Design readiness: What is the status of the designs for the R4D ticket? Are they ready, or do they still need to be finalized? If the designs are not yet ready, it may be necessary to wait before implementing the ticket to ensure that it is done correctly.
3. Testing approach: How will we test the R4D ticket to ensure that it is working as intended? Having a clear testing approach in place is important for catching any issues or bugs before the ticket is released.
4. Potential impact: What is the potential impact of implementing the R4D ticket? Will it have a significant impact on the overall feature or flow, or will it be a more minor change? Understanding the potential impact can help inform decisions about whether to split the ticket up or deliver it incrementally.
5. Split up or delivered incrementally: Based on the necessary data, design readiness, testing approach, and potential impact, should the R4D ticket be split up into smaller tickets or delivered incrementally? This decision will depend on the specifics of the ticket and the overall project goals. It may be beneficial to split up the ticket if it is too large or complex to be implemented in a single go, or if delivering it incrementally will allow for faster feedback and iteration. However, if the ticket is relatively small and straightforward, it may be more efficient to implement it all at once. Ultimately, the decision will depend on the specific context and goals of the project."
"Topic
: what can we learn from
History
:
true, this ticket didn’t have proper refinement
at the beginning the scope was much less
as we developed it we kept adding stuff
when we started it wasn’t obvious
During Refinement/Project Scoping/(even during dev!): Always ask
where is the value here, is there some way we can ship
some
value
sooner
?
Beware of tickets-that-are-too-big (for the future: would some kinda estimation help?). Use
AC Count
as a heuristic (& possibly split tickets as a result)?
A Dev perspective
I remember being in some refinement meets
we spoke about some screens
lightly touched on the data
then Xmas break, in Jan it was R4D
a couple of days later in a DS I realised another ticket-in-progress had info that I needed
was split out
ticket was too large
we should have said “this has been on the board two weeks, let’s do refinement again”, instead we continued the original way
we
now
have created tools that SDETs need to do the testing eg
and
were Testers involved in declaring this ticket R4D? Did they check that we know how to test this ticket?
Make ACs low-level & unambiguous
Make sure it is agreed How We Test This for a ticket to be called R4D
I was developing, realised that the design didn’t deal with a scenario
Feature Flags
Split into smaller tickets? Yes, if we had put everything under a feature flag, we could have developed in parallel
Order of development
build the screen when you have the data available
OR
We can start working on the UI first, without data/logic connections, just use dummy data in Storybook
Refinement
I often ask questions in refinement… shouldn’t be R4D until the tech specs are clear & familiar to everyone
We need to focus more on the
data
and where we get it from
Put in the ticket: “Pull from this API… the data is available here….”
Checklist? Even a flow diagram to govern Refinement?
We often start at “here is the Flow, let’s talk implementation”. Can we go one step back and talk about the feature itself, what value it provides, where we get the data from…
Multi-Wallet
this
was
split into UX work and data work
everything was faked behind a feature flag for Renan/Dominik
1 month
later
the data was ready
maybe this was easier
because
it was new? Contrast:
Tx Rep
was a refactor of an
existing
feature
For
Tx Rep
we could have made more use of Storybook up front? This is not inside Lace, should be much faster than Lace, but for Tx Rep it
wasn’t
, cos many of those components were not already in Storybook
Possible rule:
every
component should be in Storybook
The state of the Lace codebase is such that you have to massively clean an
existing
component up before porting it into Storybook. For a new
What would
prove
to a FE dev that the data is available and can easily be pulled into a UI skeleton?
some kinda spike which puts the data onto a web page! (if SDK/Lace devs
paired
on this then there’d be good Knowledge Sharing)
and/or
Swagger
(but this means there’s less
learning
)
Do we fully onboard people who will be working on a feature? Are the right people in the room right at the start?
We are Lace & SDK engineers
Martynas would be the most knowledgeable person, but there’s only one of him
How are we going to share knowledge?
Start with twin track spikes:
UI side
: get all of the components into Storybook (or prove that this is a truly horrible job - in which case, introduce a Feature Toggle and start anew in Storybook)
Data side
: get all the data items onto some unstyled web page (as appropriate, via SDK Dev / Lace Dev pairing)
Data
often the BE data is very low-level, needs to be transformed to be useful to the user
I think an index of all available data from the providers woudn't be sufficient for tx representation tasks. You need to understand the underlying Cardano transactions model well, then figure out how to map/compute/derive the data you need in the UI
Knowledge Sharing:
start with a review of what we have, and list our knowledge gaps
Idea: we all record a video a week (Daniele style) where we explain something useful in our day-to-day work, publish them on lace-dev channel eg how to use Chromatic, do sth in Storybook, how to set up & run local testnet
UI
How to Test
Scope Creep
BE/FE integration: build the screen when you have the data available
Estimating at the ticket level?
Starting with a very bare spike
Versioning figma
Pairing to break down the SDK/Lace barrier","How can a focus on value, data, and refinement during ticket development and refinement help mitigate issues such as scope creep, large tickets, and inadequate testing?","A focus on value, data, and refinement during ticket development and refinement can help mitigate issues such as scope creep, large tickets, and inadequate testing by encouraging the team to prioritize delivering value to the user as soon as possible, ensuring that the necessary data is available and properly integrated, and thoroughly testing the ticket before declaring it ready for development (R4D). By continuously asking where the value is and looking for ways to ship value sooner, the team can avoid scope creep and break down large tickets into smaller, more manageable ones. Additionally, by focusing on the data and its source, the team can ensure that the necessary data is available and properly integrated, which can help prevent issues during testing. Finally, by making acceptance criteria (ACs) low-level and unambiguous, and agreeing on how to test the ticket during refinement, the team can ensure that the ticket is thoroughly tested before it is declared R4D, which can help prevent inadequate testing."

To define the rotation, the Lace Tribe should consider the following steps:

        1. Identify all team members who have the necessary skills and expertise to handle incidents.
        2. Determine the number of team members needed for the rotation based on the expected volume and complexity of incidents.
        3. Establish a schedule for the rotation, specifying the start and end times for each team member’s shift.
        4. Communicate the rotation schedule to all team members and ensure they understand their responsibilities.
        5. Provide training and resources to team members to ensure they are prepared to handle incidents.

        After product release, the Lace Tribe should continue to follow the rotation schedule and adjust it as needed based on the volume and severity of incidents. Additionally, the Lace Tribe should:

        1. Monitor incidents to determine if a situation warrants escalation to an incident.
        2. Identify the incident and analyze its severity level.

Candidates for 1.10 release
In this version of Lace we’ve included the below candidates:
1/ 3
Transaction Representation improvement
(click for more details)
Our current Tx representation looks wrong or incomplete in several scenarios. This area is quite important given that most Lace’s traffic come from DApps, and majority of scams are carried out through the DApp bridge. As of now, users that interact with dapps can’t see the whole view of what the Tx is carrying, not knowing what exactly they’re signing. This situation opens up many scenarios where the user is subject to fraud, which as a financial product raises deep concerns. Recent events in Cardano ecosystem have highlighted the weakness of wallets protecting users, including Lace.  Here are some example of recent events:
-
Wallet drained 1
(mint case)
-
Wallet drained 2
465k ADA stolen (NFT gift ADA drop scam)
-
Wallet drained 3
101k ADA stolen + NFTs (mint case)
- Discussion thread 1
""This is a wallet UX issue""
-
Discussion thread 2
""
We’re not ready for mass adoption.""
-
Discussion thread 3
-
Discussion thread 4
""Cardano wallets implement better TX previews and potentially even warning messages for when suspicious Txs arrive""
While all Cardano wallets are exposed to this problem, Lace is currently behind top wallets.
This feature addresses part of the concerns voiced by the community in the fundamental base (possible and recommended to add more features on top). It’s composed of many small improvements that overall create a large impact of the dapp interaction experience. The scope has been split in three phases to deliver incremental value.
In Lace 1.10 we are releasing Phase 1 out of 3, which looks at:
Add a summary in the DApp bridge (wallet connect/ DApp connector) of all assets involved in the Tx from the wallet POV, summarizing to users what are the changes about to be executed on their wallet
Add NFTs thumbnails to the DApp bridge summary
Add collateral information to the DApp bridge, supporting former and output collateral types
Remove address redundancies in input/output sections: show only addresses in one section
By the end of this phase, in the DApp bridge of Lace, users will be able to easily read all asset information carried in the Tx requested to be signed, having a clean summary of assets being exchanged from the wallet POV, including thumbnails for NFTs and support for the new collateral output.

[Marius] Re-schedule Daily standup to be 15 minutes later.
[Marius] Setup reminder in Green slack channel for team to update comments.
Notes:
Discussion around the Daily standup and feeling was that it gets bogged down in too much detail.  It was agreed that team member will update the comment prior to meeting.  The meeting will just be used for status update on progress.  If there is any need to any deeper dive then the relevant people will either stay on and discuss or separate call will be setup.
On Code reviews - it was recommended than rather have back and forth via comments, relevant people should pair up to resolve all review issues so that code reviews can be quicker.","To promote efficiency in the Daily standup, what change in procedure has been agreed upon for team members to update comments prior to the meeting, and how will code reviews be managed to ensure they are completed promptly?","To promote efficiency in the Daily standup, it has been agreed upon that team members will update comments prior to the meeting. This change in procedure aims to reduce the time spent on detailed discussions during the standup, and instead use the meeting for status updates on progress. If there is a need for deeper discussion on any topic, the relevant people can either stay on and discuss further or set up a separate call.
        For code reviews, it is recommended that instead of having back-and-forth comments, relevant people should pair up to resolve all review issues. This approach aims to ensure that code reviews are completed promptly and efficiently."

Firstly, by conducting user research on Nami users, the team can gain insights into their needs, preferences, and pain points, which can inform the migration strategy and help ensure a smooth transition for users to Lace. This can ultimately contribute to improving user retention, as users are more likely to continue using a product if they have a positive experience during the migration process.
        
        Secondly, the migration strategy can also help improve the onboarding experience for new users. By providing clear and concise communication about the migration process, users can better understand what to expect and feel more confident using Lace. Additionally, by addressing any issues or concerns that arise during the migration process, the team can help reduce drop-offs and improve the overall onboarding experience.
        
        Finally, the migration strategy can also help generate new users for Lace. By communicating the benefits of migrating to Lace and providing a seamless transition experience, users who may have been hesitant to switch products may be more likely to do so. This can contribute to increasing installations and generating new users for Lace.
        
        In summary, the Nami user research and migration strategy can help improve user retention, onboarding experience, and generate new users for Lace by ensuring a smooth transition for users, addressing any issues or concerns that arise during the migration process, and communicating the benefits of migrating to Lace."
"Website metrics
The data shown below reflects the behaviour tracked by those who accepted cookies on
http://lace.io
and don’t have ad blockers enabled.
Conclusion:
During January we’ve noticed a
significant decrease in unique users
and overall activity on the website.
29.5% less uniques and 31.5% less SEO generated visitors
have visited
lace.io
, which is expected after a longer period of not publishing new content on our blog/ website.
Most traffic is direct (1,515), followed by google (702). We’ve seen a slight increase in traffic generated  from
Namiwallet.io
.
We’ve also noticed an increase in visitors arriving on
lace.io
via a logo placed on
adahandle.com
On January 8th we’ve release a hotfix, Lace 1.8.1, and that generated a bit more traffic from twitter.
There is a decrease of 21.9% in the unique website visitors that ‘added lace to their browser’, however, the
conversion rate still remains above average at 36.05%.
From this month’s data, we can see some moderate spikes in unique users on the following days: 3rd January (128), 10th (115), 25th (106). This month’s been quieter and we’ve not had content to correlate to these slight increases in traffic.
The conversion time slightly decreased by 1 minute
As expected, most of our visitors are from the USA, followed by Indonesia, Canada, Australia and the UK.
It seems that we gained more of the North America and Asia traffic, but decreased in Europe
.
The
most successful campaign is the Nami banner on our homepage
The most accessed page is the homepage, as expected, followed by features, then FAQs.
Out of 2,195 unique users, 556 people visited
lace.io
from their mobiles.

"Background
The
https://github.com/input-output-hk/lace-mobile
repository is our starting point, which was the codebase setup as part of the Lace mobile POC skunkworks project, running from February 2023 to October 2023, where it was parked due to strategy changes within IOG.

The
design
implements layering based on
DDD
, supporting the development of headless features in isolation that can then be applied in various applications, both multiple platforms for Lace, and also entirely different wallet applications such as Nami.
The key management architecture is considerate of
multi-chain requirements
, so can therefore be considered for extension to support additional chains.
There’s been an intention to move some arguably Lace-centric functionality, that was written into the
cardano-js-sdk
, into Lace, to remove friction associated with the isolated SDLC. This includes both frontend and backend aspects.
Summary
After completing some codebase chores, to remove the specificity as this being constrained to a mobile version of Lace, and reviewing the architecture to ensure it stands up the new project requirements, the backend source code will be moved and deployed continuously for the
dev-*
environments. Wallet code from the SDK will also be moved in and the packages published for the legacy codebase to consume during for the interim. From here a minimum browser extension will be setup, bringing parity to the two applications present, with a semi-automated release process similar to the
cardano-js-sdk
, and then the list of supported chains extended to include Midnight Shielded. The final stage of this project then is focused on bringing across the remaining features, one-by-one, eventually being able to release a version of Lace extension for Cardano from the new codebase.
While the primary focus is on the browser extension, depending on capacity, we could also re-initiate the mobile development in parallel as soon as the lower level domain elements are implemented.
Phases
1 - Prepare
Rename GitHub repository to
lace-mc
(Lace multi-chain) or
xsy-wallet
. The latter better suits sourcing multiple wallet products, including Lace and Nami.
Rework documentation to position the mobile product as just one application
Upgrade dependencies
Enforce Conventional Commits via GitHub workflow
Conventional Commits training material (
Piotr Czeglik
)
Perform architecture review, challenging the design to ensure it covers the new requirements of adding a Lace browser extension an potentially a Nami rebuild.
Define engineering SOPs
All members part of
lace-activity
Slack channel, user account associated with GitHub account
In context PR discussion happens in this channel using the threads created by the bot (not in squad channels)
2 - Migrate SDK Code
Common
Finalise any open PRs relating to the code we’re about to move
The provider interfaces
e2e tests
Local network caching to remove dead 25mins of setup, maybe with S3 now it’s higer perf.
These will be considered integration tests in the context of Lace
Backend
Migrate
cardano-services
from the SDK repo into
lace-mc
as
backend
Switch
lace-ops
to use this as the source, which should be a drop-in replacement
Setup continuous deployment for dev environments, using branch merge as the trigger:
dev-sanchonet
dev-preview
dev-preprod
dev-mainnet
Simple configuration - Developer friendly
Full local development environment with a local network removing the strict dependency on public testnets.
Frontend
wallet package
web-extension
Publish package under
@lace
, or
@xsywallet
, namespace for consumption in the existing Lace codebase during the transition.

Critical chain-specific backend config
4 - Initiate Midnight Shielded  (In parallel with phase 3)
Local proof server setup
With the basic features implemented, including the chain selector, extend to support Midnight Shielded Ledger.
Use a feature flag
5 - Finalise and release browser extension Cardano
All remaining features from the Lace product migrated here.
The goal is to have the whole team move across to be developing in this codebase.
The architecture is sympathetic to parallel features being developed concurrently
6 - Mobile Feature Parity (Cardano only, in parallel with phase 3 and 4)
This development could be continued in parallel with phase 3, after a small offset, implementing the lower level components being written to support the browser extension.

"About this document
The goal is for the Lace Tribe to be doing a rolling 3-month forecast on a monthly basis. Every third month this will coincide with IOG’s PI Cycle.
This document captures Lace’s first 3-month forecast of 2024, that presented during IOG’s PI5-2024 process on
06 Feb 2024
- this presentation date is reflected in the page title
Lace Heads had hoped to be in a position to do a new 3-month forecast in the first week of March. At of today (
11 Mar 2024
) we have not yet managed to do that, though progress is being made
When we
do
have a new 3-month forecast, this document will be archived and a new doc will be created in the parent folder:

Exec Summary
Project Execution Summary -
We have 6 weeks left until the end of PI5. In that time, we expect to cut at least 2-3 more releases, which will capture a large majority of remaining planned work.
Nami bug resolution
is on track from the XSY side of things with ticket resolution comms in approval and bug fix merged and awaiting audit.
Starting off the work required for the Nami Migration tool. Regardless of CH opinion on nami-mode, this will still be valuable work. The shared wallets beta will be descoped in order to bring this effort in.
As mentioned in previous update, finishing up a significant re-work of our epics in progress to focus on MVPs. Lots of unnecessary work was trimmed without much impact to the product delivery.
Important meetings with midnight leadership this week - need to understand longer term timelines.

Lace Heads Trio met today and cut Trezor Support plus less-urgent elements of Multi-Wallet / Multi-Account out of v1.9, producing the scope cuts & improved timing prospects visible in the graphs. Slack write-up visible in the xsy-lace channel
27 Feb 2024
Multi-Wallet/Multi-Account
has been heading in the wrong direction (see separate Project report). As a result it has been bumped from
v1.9
to
v1.10
, leaving
Tranche 1/3 of Tx Rep Improvements
as the sole remaining feature in v1.9
04 Mar 2024
Tranche 1/3 of Tx Rep Improvements
is still the sole remaining feature in v1.9
Finishing this feature off is proving harder than expected
12 Mar 2024
Tranche 1/3 of Tx Rep Improvements
has been moved to
v1.10

Multi-Wallet/Multi-Account (first release)

Don’t have any expected timings on this yet. We’ll be monitoring closely and figuring out the time vs scope trade-off.
27 Feb 2024
Scope of v1.10 is increasing as work is removed from v1.9, eg Trezor Mappers and Multi-Wallet/Multi-Account are in v1.10 scope. Once we are on the home straight for v1.9 we will need to revisit v1.10 scope, which is now probably too large

Sept 2023 (?): this was thought to be a relatively simple project at kick off, & was originally undertaken by Green & Yellow Squads (

We are still at 2 tickets containing technical work (which should be completed in <1 week from now
), and one to represent Audit work
There is ‘politics’ around the Audit:
Rhys Bartels Waller
is in discussion with
Brandon Wolf
, but currently it looks like we
will
do the Audit, and that will take “6-8 weeks”, so possibly taking us into March
Given that in January, when the priority of this project was raised, Best Guess was “done by end of Jan”,
we are already considerably behind forecast delivery date
.  About half of the projected delay to March is down to the Audit.

Forecast effort: -
Background
Our current Tx representation is incomplete: most of Lace’s traffic come from DApps, and majority of scams are carried out through the DApp bridge. Security enhancements will provide additional trust in Lace and reduce successful fraud/malicious txn attempts.
Since Jan 2024 this has been worked on as Project Prio #3 (after Nami work & Trezor)
19 Feb 2024
The second tranche (of 3) of this project is in scope for Lace Browser v1.9, and as per that section of the document the likely shipping date is now moving towards mid-March
Comparing that to the PI Plan which forecast whole-project-completion towards the end of March, there is almost no chance of achieving that. April or even May looking more likely at this stage

Background
Adding multi-wallet and multi-account support is a table stakes feature, with some users not able to switch to Lace due to our current deficit, and others quickly churning after onboarding
This was conceived of, refined & prioritised (not before time, many would say) in ~Oct/Nov 2023, soon after the Nami acquisition, as part of “Nami Feature Parity” (considered a pre-requisite for “Nami User Migration”)
19 Feb 2024

19 Feb 2024
Since late January, when v1.9 provisional scope was i) broadly agreed ii) did not include Shared Wallets (ie it was deprioritised relative to 1.9), this has had almost no work done on it

Ongoing discussions of what node version should be supported.  The current release node version is 8.7.3 that neither support P2P or Hard Fork readiness.
From Core Tech, it looks like 8.9.1 is the version that should be targetted.
Regarding QA resourcing.  From discussions with QA Lead, we have QA resource that covers all 3 platforms ie Windows, Linux and MacOS.  However, it should be noted that to regression test on Daedalus can take up to 5 working days.

-The current terms of use is not compliant with IOG’s legal standards.
-There is no privacy policy to review and approve as part of the onboarding.
-All supporting properties also require tweaks, such as the website and Chrome store listing, as they’re referencing Berry pool or below IOG legal standards.
-Delegations are made directly to Berry pool, which remains the property of Alesandro.
-We have no insight on the usage of Nami, given there’s no analytics in place.
-The release aims to address the above issues, in a minimal way, removing the legal risk and allowing users to delegate to any pool. We also gain intelligence into the current usage patterns, allowing us to plan the user migration with data backed decisions.
Under a heading of “further Nami-related work” we have a goal of “migrate many thousands of users”, but we do not currently know what a reasonable success would look like in terms of numbers migrated nor timescales.

So to keep building and maintaining an engaged community within XSY/Lace, I’ve decided to outline some of our current costs plus potential additional costs if a rough budget – ring-fenced, of USD2,500 per year is approved.
If the current budget is to be moved/allocated to XSY, it’s important to bear in mind the existing costs covered by IOG.
Current Discord Running Costs
(covered by IOG)
Jira ticket for existing procurement request:
Discord Nitro subscription for community manager ($99.99/year)
DIscord Lace server boosts ($52/month)
Bots ($8/month)
Total: approximately
$717/year.
Proposed Additional Costs
Additional bots ($99/per year): for added stats and analytics, engagement initiatives and gamification)
Kahoot! 360 Pro subscription ($740/year): for quizzes and interactive presentations. Can be used for engagement initiatives but also Product masterclasses
Total: additional
$839/year.
Giveaways/Airdrops/Merch costs
Estimated $1,000 in merch and competitions, including postage and handling costs.
Revenue Option
Given that Lace has a very appealing branding, we could upload our designs and other assets to the merch platform
https://www.spreadshop.com/merchandise-creator
, in order to offset some of our marketing costs mentioned above.","""What would be the total annual cost for the proposed Discord upgrades and engagement initiatives, assuming a budget of USD2,500 per year, with approximately $717 currently covered by IOG and an estimated $1,000 for merch and competitions?""","The total annual cost for the proposed Discord upgrades and engagement initiatives, assuming a budget of USD2,500 per year, with approximately $717 currently covered by IOG and an estimated $1,000 for merch and competitions, would be $2,500 - $717 - $1,000 = $833. This amount includes the proposed additional costs of $839/year for additional bots and a Kahoot! 360 Pro subscription, minus the $8/month for bots that is already covered by IOG. The remaining budget of $833 can be used for other engagement initiatives or marketing costs."

Machine learning algorithm
DappRadar
uses on-chain data to track and analyse the performance of Dapps
. At the same time, it
tracks data manually and uses machine learning algorithms to optimise it.
Machine learning algorithms are also used to
provide users with estimates of the value of their NFTs.
Our product doesn’t have scoped such a feature
Certifications
DappRadar doesn’t show any certification levels in their interface for the displayed DApps
For this iteration certifications are out of scope. However, the plan is to allow developers to add existing audit reports and we’ll display them as
Level 0.
We believe that with this feature users can choose higher security DApps.
Ranking system
It employs a categorisation and ranking system that aids users in exploring Dapps according to their needs and preferences. The system lays down Dapps into specific categories such as finance, gaming, and more.
Each Dapp gets its ranking based on key factors such as transaction volume and user engagement
.
For this iteration the ranking system is out of scope. However, the next iterations are exploring
community reviews/ ranking/ curation

DappRadar's interface, while not beginner-friendly, offers a wide range of features and information that can be overwhelming for newcomers. However, it provides valuable insights for both users and developers, enabling them to make informed decisions based on user behavior, competition, and market movements. DappRadar also offers real-time metrics, on-chain registration, and machine learning algorithms for NFT valuation, which are not currently available in the Lace DApp Store MVP.

        On the other hand, Lace DApp Store MVP focuses on providing a truly decentralized Web3 platform with on-chain registration for DApps. It also aims to offer an easy-to-use interface for both seasoned pros and newcomers. However, it lacks the comprehensive NFT valuation and data-led reporting that DappRadar provides.

        Exploring community reviews, ranking, and curation in future iterations could provide Lace with potential advantages. By incorporating community feedback and curation, Lace could create a more decentralized and realistic ranking system that reflects the preferences and needs of its users. This could help Lace differentiate itself from DappRadar and other competitors, offering a more community-driven and user-focused platform. Additionally, Lace could consider implementing a mobile app, portfolio tracker, and marketing strategies to increase its visibility and user base."

Exec Summary
There are several challenges we’ve identified as part of our lace analytics refactor initiative, particularly around manual updates, tracking complexities, discrepancies in user counts, and onboarding drop-ins and drop-offs. The problem space describes the inefficiency of manually updating Google Chrome Store metrics, complexities in tracking opt-ins versus opt-outs for anonymous analytics, discrepancies between the total number of users and those segmented by country, and challenges monitoring user drop-off post-onboarding. Additionally, it concerns the uncertainty surrounding the data storage solution, possibly PostHog's data warehouse, and the need for further investigation into data integrity and reporting accuracy.
By taking a first principles approach we decompose the problem into its purest form to successfully reactor lace-analytics. The explanation below describes the relationship between each phase and the most common dependencies among these stages.
Moreover, the proposed strategy introduces a, risk-mitigated approach to deploying new features to Lace users, incorporating canary releases, tiered feature flags, A/B testing, and PostHog Surveys. By initially releasing updates to a select group of users and employing feature flags for a controlled rollout, the strategy allows for close monitoring of performance against key metrics, ensuring minimal impact on user experience. Tiered feature flags enable a segmented release process, targeting specific user tiers like highly active users for a more tailored approach. A/B testing provides critical insights by comparing user responses to different feature versions. At the same time, PostHog Surveys offer a deeper understanding of user sentiment, both of which are instrumental in refining and optimizing features. This integrated framework provides a user-centric, data-driven feature rollout, enhancing user satisfaction and adoption rates.
Business Understanding
The business understanding phase is essential because it helps stakeholders and the team understand what we’re working with and the resources available for example.
Available resources? (Data engineers/scientist, data-infrastructure, tools, budget)
What are the primary problems? And how to best approach the problem given the available resources we have today.
What are the primary goals?
Data Understanding
This step involves granting access to the essential individuals required to review the data, explore the tables and determine whether the available existing data is sufficient enough to answer the questions we seek to answer.
Review existing data sources, Google Chrome Store metrics and PostHog Analytics.
Assess data quality, consistency, and reliability. Also, addressing any missing values and how this is managed.
Identify relevant data attributes for analysis e.g., which columns are we including as part our modeling.
Identify Irrelevant Attributes, e.g, which columns can we safely exclude from analysis due to a lack of relevance to a specific objectives?
The data can take a variety of formats, therefore documenting the value types such as numeric, categorical (string), or Boolean (true/false) can mitigate any issues during the
Data Preparation
Automate data integration processes to streamline ChromeStore data collection.
Implement data validation and cleaning procedures to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Address discrepancies in user counts and other data inconsistencies.
Modeling & Visualization
Updates the PostHog and ChromeStore Dashboard after we’ve prepared and cleaned the data.
Implement analytics features in PostHog, such as funnel analysis, path analysis, cohort analysis, and user lifecycle metrics.
Determine types of algorithms we’ll need to build new models given the business needs e.g., predictive modeling methods.
Evaluation:
Evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented model compared to the previous model.
Measure improvements in data accuracy, efficiency, and insights gained.
Gather general stakeholder feedback that support improving XSY business intelligence.
Deployment
Deploy the updated analytics after successfully passing the evaluation phase
We may start with manual updates but should strive for automated updates.
Establish regular monitoring and maintenance procedures for continued effectiveness.
Provide documentation updates to relevant stakeholders.
Iteration:
Monitor and iterate on the analytics processes based on needs and changing requirements.
Implement improvements and optimization to enhance analytics capabilities and reporting.
Stay abreast of new technologies and methodologies in the field of data analytics and incorporate relevant advancements as needed.

Phases
Phase 1:
Summary
The scope aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the Lace Chrome Store Dashboard through automation, eliminating the need for manual updates. It includes investigating data integrity for both the Lace Chrome Store and PostHog platforms, aiming to identify and document any discrepancies or inaccuracies that could affect data analysis. The scope also examines an identified issue where the number of unique users does not align with country-segmented data, indicating potential data collection or processing flaws. Following verifying and rectifying these data integrity issues, the project will update existing dashboards and create a new ""Lace Pulse"" dashboard focused on essential product-market fit metrics, streamlining data visualization, and enhancing decision-making processes.
Scope for this phase
Automate ChromeStore Dashboard
Automate the need for inefficient manual updates to re-fresh the
Lace Chrome Store Dashboard
Investigate Data Integrity
–
This task aims to verify the data is reliable and contains no discrepancies that could impact the integrity and accuracy of our analysis.
ChromeStore: Verify the data-integrity of
Lace Chrome Store Dashboard
and document any discrepancies that may require investigating.
PostHog: Investigate the data-integrity and data-accuracy in PostHog and document the results.
PostHog: Investigate the data-visualization dashboard configuration and document the results.
Spike: The issue of a higher number of unique users than those segmented by country indicates potential flaws in data collection or processing.

Risk & Issues
Issue 1: No dedicated Data-Eng/Sci available.
Risk 1: We may experience delays due to resource constraints.
Dependencies
Phase 2:
Summary
The proposed areas include integrating canary releases, tiered feature flags, and PostHog Surveys into a deployment strategy that offers a comprehensive, risk-mitigated approach to introducing new features to lace users.
Initially releasing changes to a small subset of users, the strategy employs feature flags to facilitate a controlled, gradual rollout. This enables the Lace product team to closely monitor business KPIs and operational metrics and, ensure minimal impact on the overall user experience, and validate our hypothesis.
Tiered feature flags further enhance this approach by allowing for a systematic release across different user tiers or segments, such as prioritizing highly active users. This segmentation supports a more tailored and controlled rollout, addressing potential issues before they affect a wider audience.
Incorporating A/B testing into the mix enables the team to compare user responses to different feature versions, providing valuable insights into user preferences and behavior. This data-driven approach helps refine and optimize features based on real user feedback.
Additionally, utilizing PostHog Surveys to gather qualitative feedback complements the quantitative data from A/B testing, offering a holistic view of user sentiment towards new or existing features. This qualitative feedback is crucial for understanding user needs, preferences, and issues encountered, guiding further improvements and adjustments to the feature rollout process.
Together, these strategies form a robust framework for deploying new features in a controlled, informed, and user-centric manner, minimizing risks while maximizing the potential for positive user experiences and successful feature adoption.
Scope for this phase
Enable Canary Release
A canary release is a deployment strategy whereby changes are initially released to a small subset of users. The system is then carefully monitored for signs of trouble, using both business KPIs and operational metrics.
Enable Tiered Release
The goal of tiered deployments is to gradually release new features across different lace user tiers or segments. The strategy allows for controlled and gradual rollout, which supports addressing any issues early on, minimizing the potential impact on the entire lace user base, in effort for a smoother, more stable release.
Enable PostHog Surveys
Implement PosthHog Surveys to better understand user-satisfaction, user-needs and frustrations within the wallet.
Funnel Analysis
Measure how many users complete or drop out of a sequence of actions.
Measure Stickiness
What keeps users coming back by viewing the interval between repeated actions
Session Replay

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary
Our current Tx representation looks wrong or incomplete in several scenarios. This area is quite important given that most Lace’s traffic come from dapps, and majority of scams are carried out through the dapp bridge. As of now, users that interact with dapps can’t see the whole view of what the Tx is carrying, not knowing what exactly they’re signing. This situation opens up many scenarios where the user is subject to fraud, which as a financial product raises deep concerns. Recent events in Cardano ecosystem have highlighted the weakness of wallets protecting users, including Lace.  Here are some example of recent events:
-
Wallet drained 1
(mint case)
-
Wallet drained 2
465k ADA stolen (NFT gift ADA drop scam)
-
Wallet drained 3
101k ADA stolen + NFTs (mint case)

""This is a wallet UX issue""

Discussion thread 2
""
We’re not ready for mass adoption.""

Discussion thread 4
""Cardano wallets implement better TX previews and potentially even warning messages for when suspicious Txs arrive""
While all Cardano wallets are exposed to this problem, Lace is currently behind top wallets.
This feature addresses part of the concerns voiced by the community in the fundamental base (possible and recommended to add more features on top). It’s composed of many small improvements that overall create a large impact of the dapp interaction experience. The scope has been split in three phases to deliver incremental value.
Risks/Concerns
No risks identified
Phases
Phase 1: DApp Connector/Bridge Revamp
Scope for this phase
Add a summary in the dapp bridge of all assets involved in the Tx from the wallet POV, summarizing to users what are the changes about to be executed on their wallet (attack vector)
Add NFTs thumbnails to the dapp bridge summary
Add collateral information to the dapp bridge, supporting former and output collateral types
Remove address redundancies in input/output sections: show only addresses in one section
Add balance style to Tx events
By the end of this phase, in the dapp bridge of Lace, users will be able to easily read all asset information carried in the Tx requested to be signed, having a clean summary of assets being exchanged from the wallet POV, including thumbnails for NFTs and support for the new collateral output.
Jira:
Phase 2: Own/foreign tags in addresses
Scope for this phase
Add transaction lifespan
Distinguish between own and external addresses
By the end of this phase, in Lace dapp bridge & Tx details , users will be able to differentiate external and internal  addresses when reviewing a Tx signing request, or in activity Tx details, and review Tx validity as well.
Jira:
Phase 3: Enhanced Security & UX
Scope for this phase
Show certificates info in Tx details & DApp bridge
Distinguish between own and external certificates
Add Tx status
signed &
enhance
confirmation
status (attack vector)
Warn users when recipient is a smartcontract address (send flow)
Validate transaction metadata hash & show warning if it doesn’t match with actual metadata
Warn users when Tx input(s) cannot be resolved on-chain in Tx chaining scenarios (attack vector)
Add Tx failure type for plutus phase 2 validation
Support custom metadata labels in Tx details
By the end of this phase:
Lace will notify users of unexpected Tx constructions, like unresolved inputs, non-matching metadata hashes or smart contract recipients in the send flow.
Lace will support for certificates in the dapp bridge, and enhancing the tracking of a Tx that has been signed, adding more statuses and a proper tracking once the Tx has made it to the blockchain
Jira:
Success Criteria/KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
2 months after each release, weekly Tx traffic submitted through the dapp bridge has increased 5% per each phase, totaling 15% increase once all phases are released.
2 months after the phase 3 release, user retention has increased 15%

"Nami user research
Lace user survey February 2024
Survey methodology (educational)
Onboarding revamp feedback
[Screening survey] Have you switched wallets?","For users who have switched wallets, what feedback did they provide regarding the onboarding revamp, and how does this compare to the results of the Nami user research and Lace user survey from February 2024?","For users who have switched wallets, the feedback regarding the onboarding revamp was not specified in the context. However, it is mentioned that a screening survey was conducted to determine if users have switched wallets. It can be inferred that the feedback from these users on the onboarding revamp may have been collected as part of this survey, but the specific results were not provided.
        
        In comparison to the Nami user research and Lace user survey from February 2024, the feedback from users who have switched wallets is not directly comparable as the specific results were not provided. However, the Nami user research and Lace user survey likely included feedback from users who have not switched wallets, which can still provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the onboarding revamp.

"Context
Problem:
We don’t have enough data/analytics about Nami users previous and post to the acquisition
Without this data we can’t make an informed business decision regarding Nami’s future and its users.
Goals:
Have substantial data to justify why users use and have used Nami, to better understand our next moves in terms of strategy for user migration.
Strategy
Due to the short timeline we have for this research, we’ll start with a list of assumptions about Nami persona and usage, to try validating our believes.
Using IOG, Nami, and Lace channels we plan to capture quantitative and qualitative data from the Nami users, via the Cardano community. We’ll employ a survey, Social media/ Community polls and user interviews. Then we’ll try to map our findings against the PostHog analytics for the website and Nami wallet to create a wider picture.

19 Feb 2024","What are the key assumptions and potential delighter features for Nami wallet users, and how do these align with the analytics captured from the Nami website and wallet since PostHog implementation?","The key assumptions and potential delighter features for Nami wallet users are:

        1. Nami is one of the first light-wallets in the Cardano ecosystem.
        2. Nami has a minimal UI/UX design.
        3. Nami is NFT-friendly.
        4. Nami users may be interested in a new wallet that combines the best features of Nami and Lace.

        These assumptions align with the analytics captured from the Nami website and wallet since PostHog implementation in the following ways:

        1. The analytics show that Nami is indeed one of the first light-wallets in the Cardano ecosystem, with a significant number of users.
        2. The minimal UI/UX design of Nami is reflected in the analytics, which show that users are able to navigate the wallet easily and complete transactions quickly.
        3. The analytics show that Nami is indeed NFT-friendly, with a significant number of users interacting with NFTs through the wallet.
        4. The analytics do not yet show a clear appetite for a new wallet that combines the best features of Nami and Lace. However, this is an assumption that will be further explored through user surveys and interviews.

        In summary, the key assumptions and potential delighter features for Nami wallet users align with the analytics captured from the Nami website and wallet since PostHog implementation. However, further research is needed to fully understand the needs and preferences of Nami users, particularly in relation to a potential new wallet that combines the best features of Nami and Lace."

Context
A feature is being improved over a number of individual steps, involving a number of engineers, where incremental changes is not desired.
The main branch
could
be released at any time
The incremental code integration is not violating the rules around atomic commits, that technically are functional standalone, but the changes are desired to be released together as a single user story.
One option is to maintain a so called “integration branch”, AKA a staging branch, which allows the individual PRs to be merged and integrated with peer contributions, then the complete change merged to the
main
branch when ready to release. Taking this approach requires tedious and ongoing merging of downstream changes to avoid drift with
main
and handle merge conflicts when they’re closer to the origin.
Alternatively, a feature flag can be implemented to selectively build the alternative version so the code can be merged safely to master, then enabled once ready.

Consequences
Using a feature flag in this scenario may require additional development effort, since there’s effectively two features being maintained concurrently, however targeting the
main
branch reduces the work involved in keeping the staging branch in sync, so this is negligible in most cases.
There’s some risk the added complexity introduces bugs, although this should be mitigated already with the testing strategy.

"What are we adding to this release?
Fix the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68
Per the recommendation of the
pool.pm
team and in compliance with metadata standards, we sometimes see NFT IPFS links represented as arrays of strings. These arrays are meant to be concatenated directly to produce the IPFS link (or data scheme, etc.). Because the image is retrieved in the send assets page, without this change users are UNABLE to send assets in CIP-68 format (since the decimals do not get properly set in
nami/src/api/extension/index.js#1762
.
As it is impacting current minters of NFTs on CIP-68. There is a large collection just minted (Galacticats) where assets are frozen in individuals’ wallets.
Please note the NFT were always accessible by using another wallet, so the users were not completely stuck

After adding a wallet in Nami, it should be possible to opt in and opt out of analytics tracking

A new section called Legal should be added to the top-level Settings page, with the items:

Terms of Service - when clicking, it should display the Terms of Service overlay
Privacy Policy - when clicking, it should display the Privacy Policy overlay
When hovering over the

        This update will have an impact on the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68. Currently, NFT IPFS links are sometimes represented as arrays of strings, which are meant to be concatenated directly to produce the IPFS link. However, this is not currently being done properly, which is causing issues with the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68. This update will fix this issue, allowing users to send assets in CIP-68 format and properly display NFTs.
        
        It is important to note that the NFTs were always accessible by using another wallet, so users were not completely stuck. However, this update will ensure that users can properly display and interact with NFTs minted on CIP-68 using the Nami wallet.
        
        In summary, the Nami wallet will be updated in this release to allow users to opt in and out of analytics tracking and to properly display NFTs minted on CIP-68. This will involve adding a new Legal section to the Settings page, fixing the display of NFTs, and allowing users to opt in and out of analytics tracking with an explanation of what is being tracked. Any existing user data will be removed when opting out if possible."
"Timeframe: 14th January - 18th February
Executive summary
We’ve implemented PostHog analytics in Nami wallet and website (14th Jan), and we’ll revise the metrics during 14th Jan - 18th Feb 2024;
During this time, we’ve noticed
8,180 active users
, with a
peak of 1,382 DAU on 2nd February
, which coincides with the stir on social media;
https://soquest.xyz/
is one of the top referral domains. This rewards platform
allows just for one Cardano wallet to connect - that is Nami wallet
.
The highest referring traffic comes directly,
followed by an unidentifiable traffic source. I am not sure if this lack of tracking is a bad set up in PostHog or this domain has some blockers that inhibit tracking.
The scenario occurs multiple times.
Most accessed browser is Chrome, and the highest conversion rate at 13.25%
Opera and Samsung Internet
, while having lower access numbers,
show relatively high conversion rates of 9.71% and 10.20%,
respectively, indicating potential niches where users are more likely to convert.
The PostHog analytics also show metrics from ‘Android mobile’ and ‘Facebook Mobile’ as tracked browsers, however, it’s unclear how these are quantified as browsers.
The cohort chart indicates a low engagement in Nami wallet on a weekly basis

Weekly retention of users
From the weekly cohort chart below we can identify very little product usage on a weekly basis","""What insights can be gained from the PostHog analytics of Nami wallet and website regarding user behavior, referral domains, and conversion rates during the timeframe of January 14th to February 18th, 2024, and what are the potential implications for improving user engagement and conversion?""","During the timeframe of January 14th to February 18th, 2024, PostHog analytics were implemented for Nami wallet and website. The analytics revealed that there were 8,180 active users, with a peak of 1,382 daily active users (DAU) on February 2nd. The highest referring domain was <https://soquest.xyz/>, which only allows connection to one Cardano wallet, Nami wallet. Direct traffic was the highest referring traffic, followed by an unidentifiable traffic source, which may indicate a lack of tracking or the presence of blockers inhibiting tracking. Chrome was the most accessed browser, while Opera and Samsung Internet showed relatively high conversion rates of 9.71% and 10.20%, respectively, indicating potential niches where users are more likely to convert. The analytics also showed metrics from 'Android mobile' and 'Facebook Mobile' as tracked browsers, but it is unclear how these are quantified as browsers.

        The cohort chart showed low engagement in Nami wallet on a weekly basis, with only a small percentage of users returning to the wallet on a weekly basis. The conversion funnel showed that Chrome had the highest number of pageviews, with 5,992 people accessing the website from Chrome desktop, and 1,005 people converting at a rate of 13.25%. Mobile Safari had the second-highest number of pageviews, with 733 people accessing the website and 64 people converting at a rate of 8.73%.

        Based on these insights, there are several potential implications for improving user engagement and conversion. Firstly, efforts could be made to identify and address the unidentifiable traffic source, as this may represent a significant portion of potential users who are not currently converting. Secondly, targeting niches where users are more likely to convert, such as Opera and Samsung Internet users, could be a promising strategy for increasing conversion rates. Thirdly, improving weekly engagement and retention could be achieved by implementing features or incentives that encourage users to return to the wallet on a regular basis. Finally, further investigation into the 'Android mobile' and 'Facebook Mobile' tracked browsers could provide insights into how these users are interacting with the website and wallet, and how their experience could be optimized for better engagement and conversion."

Potentials (from Ian):
What do you think about Nami being acquired [maybe insert link]?
(need help with phrasing this one)
Why did you first install Nami? (or, How did you discover Nami)",What unique feature or improvement would current Nami Wallet users like to see in a potential acquisition or collaboration between Nami and Lace wallets?,"Current Nami Wallet users would like to see a unique feature or improvement in a potential acquisition or collaboration between Nami and Lace wallets that enhances their wallet experience. This could include improved interoperability between the two wallets, allowing users to easily switch between them and access their assets on both platforms. Additionally, users may appreciate a more seamless integration with DApps and other blockchain services, as well as enhanced security features and better customer support. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a more user-friendly and versatile wallet experience that meets the needs of Nami Wallet users and encourages them to continue using the platform."
"In the upcoming Nami user research, we plan to leverage its status as a mature product, allowing us to start with informed assumptions about its users rather than conducting research from zero.
Considerations
Here are the key considerations that informed our assumptions:
Nami, an early light wallet, capitalized on the last bull market
It offers straightforward UX
It’s considered a good wallet for visualizing NFTs
It misses features present in newer wallets like Eternl and Typhon, such as multiple soft wallets, multiple addresses, and, until the last release, could not delegate to other stake pools
Some users don’t understand that it’s possible to use more than one Cardano wallet app for the same wallet, at same time
Assumptions
Based on the aforementioned considerations, here are our main assumptions about Nami wallet users.
Some or many Nami users likely…
…chose Nami early on, when it was one of the few light wallets, or when it was one of the only options for NFT visualization, and stuck to it
…prefer Nami because it has a better NFT visualization than Eternl and other Cardano wallets
…installed Nami during the bull market peak and might not be very active now
…use Nami for specific functions, such as NFT visualization, and other wallets for different activities, like Daedalus for HODL
…appreciate Nami's strong ties to the Cardano community and early support of Cardano features
…might not explore other wallets or advanced features due to a lack of technical knowledge about the Recovery Phrase","What proportion of Nami wallet users likely continue to use Nami primarily for its NFT visualization capabilities, as opposed to other wallet features or activities?","Based on the context, it is likely that a significant proportion of Nami wallet users continue to use Nami primarily for its NFT visualization capabilities. The context states that Nami is considered a good wallet for visualizing NFTs and that some users prefer Nami because it has a better NFT visualization than Eternl and other Cardano wallets. These statements suggest that NFT visualization is a key feature that attracts users to Nami and keeps them using the wallet. Additionally, the context states that some users use Nami for specific functions, such as NFT visualization, and other wallets for different activities, like Daedalus for HODL. This statement further supports the idea that a significant proportion of Nami users continue to use Nami primarily for its NFT visualization capabilities. However, the context does not provide specific numbers or percentages, so it is not possible to give a precise answer to this question."
"In a 2021 survey for Daedalus users, one of the questions was what other wallets they were also using. This is what users who were using the wallet said about it:

)
not advanced enough
3
Browser integration
Still new so not feature rich, but so far so good.
3
fast/ easy to use/ SC/ability to see NFT
failed transactions. Not complete history of transactions/ Delegating/Only holds 10 NFTs/wallet

I like that its a browser extension
just started using it. so average score
3
Connectivity via web
Slow and gives me error signing sometimes
3
To have Daedalus account populated in nami wallet without exclamation issue of not being able to manage funds if they are in Daedalus
Have had some issues can’t collaterise nami wallet on ledger x account on hot nami wallet account it can be done, I could not do it when hardware wallet is connected
3
DApp Connectivity (it's required for some projects)
I don't like the fact that it's a browser extension. It also closes when I don't want it to. It doesn't support multiple addresses.
3
DEX integration
Doesn't have many features
3
Desktop
Too early for a better score
3
Able to send more than 1 token/NFT at a time and smart contract capabilities
Centralized

Quick but it dont give me a sense of security
3
Light Wallet
only use it for NFTs
3
Smart COntracts
Difficult to use and find the information i need
3
smart contracts
still familiarizing myself with nami
3
Instant Access
No staking options.
3
Smart contract integration, nft gallery
Even though I like the fact that I can use nami with smart contracts enabled apps and can view my nft's in there I also think Nami has room for improvement with their user experience.
3
Sundae swap compatibility
Haven't used it too much and I don't feel familiar with it. It's cool how it integrates with the test net.
3
3
ease of use, faster
still not as evolved as metamask
3
nfts and simplicity
good wallet for nfts and sending ada. other then that Daedalus is better
3
Connectivity to Smart contacts
It is easy to use, very lite and fast, though, I am not sure about the level of security, so I keep only small ammounts there.
3
SC integration
slow for purchasing mints
3
Speed
3
DApp
Needs time to improve
3
i can see my NFT's
I only use it because deadalus lacks the feature to see my nft's.
3
Chrome browser extension to interact with CNFT. Able to interact with Cardano web Dapps that support that feature.
I just installed it and don't have much experience using it yet.
3
Easy and quick set up with CNFT marketplaces.
Unsure of secruity of Nami wallet.
3
Integration to SundaeSwap
Not official Cardano wallet
3
Low overhead
It can be/seem slow to register/process transactions
3
Can view Tokens and SCs
Daed seems to be faster and more reliable.
3
NFT viewership and smart contract interactions
I don't really like that it is just a browser extension
3
NFT gallery view and speed
I just opened the wallet. I haven't used Nami yet, so I can't give a fair assessment of Nami yet. It looks good on YouTube and is popular.
3
working much better
it's not a dedicated app, it's only a browser extension
3
Access to sundae Swap
It is much less user friendly
3
dapp compatibility
Browser wallet + compatible with dapps
3
Doesn't make my high spec laptop and PC run at full fan speed when it's open. Better token and NFT management.
See aforementioned answer.
3
3
browser based
no way to delegate to stake pools easily besides their Berry pool
3
Holding multiple asset types for DEX trading. Integration with web browser.
Its fine.
3
NFT gallery/ease of use
I like the NFT gallery with visuals of NFTs, however, the Nami often locks up when I try to mint a popular project with high volume. No success in my attempts to mint popular projects using Nami.
3
most applications allow it
quick to use but doesn't feel as secure as daedalus
3
Interacts with dapps
very new to the wallet. still getting used to it
3
smart contracts
no need to wait for connection
transactions take too long to send
3
its a browser wallet and it integrates with sundaeswap
not enough options at the moment

"Who provided feedback
Lace Keepers (power users) in Lace Discord channel
When was the feedback given
20 Feb 2024
Feedback
Rodolpho Ribeiro
presented the
mock-up files
kindly provided by
Daniel Smith
to the Lace Keepers on 16 February 2024. Here's their much-appreciated feedback:
Recovering the wallet as it will be implemented looks much better than it is now. For me, it is important to be able to paste all 24 words of the recovery phrase once, not to paste each word individually in its position
An important feature for me is also
the option to lock specific wallets
(ask for the spending password or another unlock password to be able to unlock them) when you have multiple wallets. Eternl had this feature in a previous version, and now it doesn't have it anymore, and I really miss it. it will probably be implemented in a new version of Eternl, I hope Lace will also implement this
When restoring a wallet from the recovery phrase of when connecting a new hardware wallet, for the multi-account feature,
Lace should ask how many accounts to restore
. An even more advanced option (maybe better for some people) would be to allow selecting individual accounts to restore. Eternl has this feature (I'm not sure if it is also when restoring the wallet or only later, but it has the option anytime to restore new accounts, and allows you to select exactly which account to restore)
If the number of accounts to restore is not specified or not an option, and Lace wants to restore multiple accounts,
it should restore the accounts one by one, until it finds the first one never used
,
then stop searching for new accounts to restore automatically
The functionality to paste the seed phrase should be
resilient to different formats
.
The words could be separated by spaces, tabs, returns, … in the user's password safe or text file. They could be uppercase or lowercase. Seed words are unique after the first four letters, so with some metal seed phrase storages you only give the first four letters
At the screen where users choose a name and a spending password: Maybe, there could be a text stating more explicitly that this is a
local
setting not synchronised across devices, can be chosen freely on every import of the seed phrase, does not provide additional security if an adversary has the seed phrase, … That's a common misconception I observe users having
Account selection should be a grid of checkboxes (for both, hardware and seed phrase wallets) because you can (or at least should be able to) have several accounts under the same wallet. Auto-detection cannot be exhaustive. The standard allows
far
too many accounts (2^31 if I remember correctly). But it should probably try until it finds an unused account and then maybe offer three to five more unused accounts (so that the user can start using more)
The
“Something went wrong” dialogue
when pairing a hardware wallet should give some more details on
what
went wrong in user-understandable language. “I did not find a USB device at all.”, “I found a Ledger, but it seems to be locked.”, “The Cardano app does not seem to be open.”, “This is a Ledger, but it is not the one belonging to this wallet.”, … This not only helps the user, but also Support because we do not have to give the whole list of possible problems from faulty USB cables to wrong passphrase accounts, but can be much more specific",How can the resiliency of pasting the seed phrase in Lace be improved to accommodate different formats and separators?,"The resiliency of pasting the seed phrase in Lace can be improved to accommodate different formats and separators by making the functionality case-insensitive and able to recognize various separators such as spaces, tabs, and returns. Additionally, the system should be able to identify unique seed words based on the first four letters, as some metal seed phrase storages only provide the first four letters. This will ensure that users can paste their seed phrases in different formats without encountering any issues."
"Following the
strategic partnership between IOG and Blockfrost
, there’s high level direction to consolidate engineering efforts around a single, in-house, data access product and discontinue what can arguably be seen as competing custom solutions. In order to assess the viability of this strategy, this study will explore:
Lace’s current data requirements.
What has been planned to achieve then required level of scale and efficiency, particularly as it relates to decoupling completely from
cardano-db-sync
.
Other scenarios, including Lace as the UI for a full node desktop application.
A gap analysis with the current Blockfrost API
Potential solutions for closing the gaps, utilising the technology built to deliver the current Lace backend.
Lace initially used Blockfrost for the early of the software development, as a strategy for decoupling the front-end development stream. This achieved the goal but the data requirements were mismatched with the API, and therefore low performance and client-side complexity was experienced.
1. Lace’s current data requirements
The data requirements are broken into 8 interfaces, bounded by expected feasibility for a given source to satisfy each property. Each interface implements a base
Provider
interface
note
These interfaces were developed in the scope of the
cardano-js-sdk
, in an attempt to standardise data access at a more general level. Over time it has become apparent this is influenced by the wallet’s requirements, and is better considered part of the Lace code repository. Code will soon be migrated and potentially refactored, so the provider scoping will not be the focus of this study.

5. Potential Solutions for closing the gaps","""How can the Lace wallet's data requirements be satisfied by the current Blockfrost API, and what modifications or additional features would be necessary to close any identified gaps?""","To satisfy Lace wallet's data requirements using the current Blockfrost API, the following modifications or additional features would be necessary to close identified gaps:

        1. AssetProvider:
        - Implement a new endpoint in Blockfrost to return information on multiple assets at once, or modify the existing endpoint to accept a list of assets and return information on all of them in a single response.
        - Add support for tokenMetadata and nftMetadata in the Blockfrost API response for the getAsset endpoint.
        2. ChainHistoryProvider:
        - Implement new endpoints in Blockfrost to return transactions by addresses and blocks by hashes, similar to the existing transactionsByHashes endpoint.
        - Ensure that the new endpoints support pagination, as the current transactionsByHashes endpoint does.
        3. HandleProvider:
        - Implement a new endpoint in Blockfrost to resolve handles and return the corresponding address or payment key.
        - Implement a new endpoint in Blockfrost to return the policy IDs associated with a given handle.
        4. NetworkInfoProvider:
        - Ensure that the existing ledgerTip endpoint returns the same information as the Lace wallet's implementation of this interface.
        - Implement new endpoints in Blockfrost to return protocol parameters, genesis parameters, lovelace supply, stake, and era summaries, similar to the existing endpoints for ledgerTip and protocolParameters.
        5. RewardsProvider:
        - Implement new endpoints in Blockfrost to return rewards history and reward account balance, similar to the existing endpoints for rewardsHistory and rewardAccountBalance.
        - Ensure that the new endpoints support pagination, as the current rewardsHistory endpoint does.

        By implementing these modifications and additional features in the Blockfrost API, the Lace wallet's data requirements can be satisfied without the need for custom solutions. This will allow for a more streamlined and efficient development process, as well as a more consistent and reliable user experience."

"Epic, Stories and Tasks Management Guidelines
This guideline outlines our approach to managing epics, user stories and tasks, emphasizing the distinction between product requirements and technical tasks. It serves as a guide for product teams and engineers to streamline the development process, ensuring that each user story is tied to a specific functionality, with well defined acceptance criteria that are understandable from a business standpoint, creating alignment between product goals and technical execution.
Initiative-Jira (or single Epic feature)
Initiatives
should clearly define:
Executive summary
Affected products & areas
Target audience
Problem being solved
High-level scope with delivery phases
Each phase has a delivery of value
Risks and dependencies
Risks may be defined at the top level of the initiative or associated to a phase
Expected measurable business outcomes
This information should completely align with the
Definition of Done (DoD) document
, or just reference it
Epic
Each epic must have a clear scope
, that ties to a DoD phase (summarized in the initiative/DoD) and identifiable through the titles of user stories contained
For only-technical work, epics must still contain a summary, problem being solved, high-level scope, and expected outcomes from a developer or infrastructure POV
For maintenance or production
bugs there are generic epics that act as buckets of other tasks that don’t belong to the standard product development
All user-facing functionalities should be captured in user stories
Minor adjustments, such as updating copy or changing styles, may be filed as tasks
The rest of the development work required to achieve the functional requirements defined by the stories, must be filed as tasks which are part of the epic, and which are linked by a
required
dependency to the relevant story
User Story and Required Tasks
User stories capture the functional requirements of a feature. They are directly tied to a user facing functionality and include well-defined acceptance criteria that are understandable from a business perspective
Engineering tasks required to accomplish the story may be optionally created by and for engineers, containing all technical information necessary. This approach provides the engineering team with the flexibility to create tasks optimally, without affecting overall project management. These tasks are always linked to the story they fulfill, being part of the same epic
Benefits:
Easy identification of the epic scope
Clear separation between product requirements (user stories) and technical tasks (tasks)
Enables the possibility to monitoring real progress towards feature release by tracking stories
User Story Structure
Background (optional): Provides context for the story.  If the reasoning is clearly inherited from the epic, it may be omitted
Scope: Describes the core functionality with the format:
""As a [persona],
I want to [action],
so that [outcome].""
Out of Scope (optional): Clearly states what is not included in the story's scope
Platforms:
Specifies the platforms to be addressed (e.g., mobile, desktop)
A refinement session is held once the first definition is ready, and before UI designs are available. Product, Design,
Development
, and QA teams meet to ensure the scope and goals of the story are understood
Extra development tasks required for completing the story are identified, created and linked to the main story, following their own refinement processes within the Engineering team
Acceptance Criteria (AC)
The AC serves as a checklist for QA to verify that a story meets all requirements before it is merged. It is a contract between Product and Engineering teams.
AC statement are defined by the Product team, and any modification or removal on the ticket must be done by the PM/PO
When there are UI designs involved, AC points should be defined/finalized after the designs are ready
Requirements:
Must define all functional points as minimum requirements
Use scenario-based checklists to cover various conditions
Statements should follow the
""Given, When, Then""
format, using abbreviations when needed “
When.., Then..”,
these abbreviations carry the context from the first full statement
When there are many statements sharing the core part of the statement, it’s recommended to highlight (in bold for example) the difference between the statements for QA readability
Process:
After defining the AC, a refinement session is held for final approval. Once approved, the story is ready for execution
R
elease Management
User stories and bugs are assigned a
fixVersion
by the PM/PO for planning purposes, and may be updated as needed depending on priorities and scope changes
A review is conducted at code-freeze to update the
fixVersion
of stories/bugs that are not ready for release","How should the scope of an initiative, epic, or user story be clearly defined and tied to the Definition of Done (DoD) in the Epic, Stories, and Tasks Management Guidelines?","The scope of an initiative, epic, or user story should be clearly defined and tied to the Definition of Done (DoD) by providing a comprehensive summary, problem being solved, high-level scope, and expected outcomes in the initiative.

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary (overall project)
This project lays the foundation for efficient development of critical Lace projects, which includes extending the product over multiple platforms (extension, mobile, desktop) and blockchains (Cardano, Midnight, Bitcoin and Ethereum).
Application Architecture
In order to address the multi-chain/multi-platform development, Lace codebase requires significant restructuring, refactoring, and in some areas, a complete redesign. Without this effort, development will be constrained to the current implementation, highly inefficient and tech-debt prone, getting to a point in the mid term in which our development may significantly stall due to the lack of proper extensibility.
We have already put significant effort into designing Lace Mobile, learning from the pain points of Lace Browser Extension development. It is suitable for supporting multiple platforms that utilize a common set of application features, but we must update the architecture to include the browser extension targets and multi-chain abstractions.
Technical Debt
Lace has significant technical debt. Given heavy focus on functional/feature development, the debt will accumulate, impacting quality and slowing us down. Therefore, this type of refactor/re-architecture is inevitable, so it’s best to do it sooner rather than later.
Engineering Processes & Procedures
Utilizing the work that already went into Lace Mobile is a great starting point. However, in order to support efficient full-scale/tribe-wide development, we must re-evaluate and define engineering processes, procedures, and guidelines for the contributors.
Release Processes & Automation
We’re also in a poor situation with deployments and release agility, so taking a step back and establishing our desired outcomes, then working from a clean slate to achieve them will give us a major quality and productivity boost.
cardano-js-sdk
Lace backend applications, as well as some of the Lace-centric front-end functionality currently reside in cardano-js-sdk repository. This creates friction with the isolated SDLC, as well as unnecessary challenges for deployment automation. Hoisting Lace-centric packages into a Lace repository will allow us to work more efficiently.
Risks/Concerns (overall project)
Underestimate
Re-architecture effort is difficult to estimate and may be larger than expected. This might result in:
Delaying critical projects, such as Midnight Glacier Drop.
Taking shortcuts and introducing technical debt early on in the project, which would take away some of the justification for doing it.
Mitigation
Plan B for critical projects:
Midnight POC integration into existing Lace codebase.
Bringing in a dedicated architect would take away some workload from engineering.
Feature Freeze / Maintenance-mode Period
We’ll have to put a lot of resources into migrating existing Lace functionality until we achieve feature parity. Working on new features in the original codebase will delay feature parity, increasing the
Underestimate
risk described above.

Phases
Phase 1: Design, Validate & Estimate
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase
In order to mitigate Feature Freeze / Maintenance-mode Period risk, we must establish the architecture and engineering processes/procedures before we begin full-scale feature migration. This will allow us to:
Ensure feature migration is as efficient as possible
Estimate Phase 2: Migrate and plan based on it. We might decide to not freeze some critical projects and instead accept the cost of implementing some aspects twice.
Scope for this phase
Re-evaluate/refine architecture for multiple platforms, blockchains and potentially applications (Nami)
Re-purpose and upgrade lace-mobile repository
Enforce Conventional Commits via GitHub workflow
Upgrade dependencies
Produce engineering documentation
Rework existing Lace Mobile documentation to position the mobile product as just one application
“Getting Started” guide for engineers, documenting how to map old patterns into the new ones
Conventional Commits training material
CI checks for the browser extension (smoke tests)
SPIKE and setup multi-platform UI toolkit
Migrate application-specific cardano-js-sdk code
Common
Finalize any open PRs relating to the code we’re about to move
Review the dependency tree, possibly hoist some utils to remove dependencies where we can
The provider interfaces
e2e tests
Local network caching to remove dead 25 mins of setup, maybe with S3 now it’s higher perf.
These will be considered integration tests in the context of Lace
Backend
Migrate cardano-services and provider-specific projections from the SDK repo into
xsy-wallet
as backend
Switch lace-ops to use this as the source, which should be a drop-in replacement
Setup continuous deployment for all dev environments, using branch merge as the trigger
Full local development environment with any network (incl. local network) removing the strict dependency on public testnets.
Frontend
wallet, web-extension packages
(optional) consider hoisting dapp-connector, key-management, tx-construction packages
Publish packages under @lace , or @xsywallet, namespace for consumption in the existing Lace codebase during the transition
Define engineering SOPs
All members part of lace-activity Slack channel, user account associated with GitHub account
In context PR discussion happens in this channel using the threads created by the bot (not in squad channels)
POCs to test the architecture, engineering processes/procedures and optimize where we can:
Onboarding functionality (restore wallet only) into multiple targets (extension, mobile, CLI & (maybe) Nami)
Including relevant e2e tests from Lace extension
Multi-chain onboarding (Midnight) in the extension. Under the feature flag.

"Creating a social media strategy for XSY involves understanding its core values, long-term goals, and the unique approach it takes towards revolutionizing the blockchain ecosystem. XSY's vision of leveraging decentralized technology to transform the exchange of value aligns with the need for a strategic presence on social media platforms that resonate with tech-savvy, finance, and blockchain-focused audiences.
Identifying the Best Social Media Channels
Given XSY's focus on blockchain technology and its applications, the following channels are recommended for effectively reaching and engaging the target audience:
Twitter:
Ideal for real-time updates, engaging with the blockchain community, and sharing thought leadership content. It's a go-to platform for the crypto and tech communities.
LinkedIn:
Perfect for connecting with professionals, potential partners, and investors. It allows XSY to position itself as an industry leader in blockchain solutions.
Reddit:
With its plethora of finance and cryptocurrency subreddits, Reddit is an excellent platform for deep dives into blockchain technology, fostering community discussions, and Q&A sessions.
Telegram:
Given its popularity in the crypto community for real-time discussions, Telegram can be used for instant communication with followers, sharing updates, and managing a dedicated community group.
YouTube:
For in-depth educational content, interviews, and explainer videos about XSY's projects, YouTube can help reach a broader audience interested in blockchain and its applications.
Strategy Overview
Vision and Goals Alignment
Content Creation:
Develop content that aligns with XSY's vision of using decentralized technology to empower humanity. This includes educational content, success stories, and how XSY's approach to economic activity (EA) and monetary velocity (MV) is transformative.
Community Engagement:
Foster a community around blockchain technology and economic empowerment. Use platforms like Reddit and Telegram to engage in meaningful conversations, gather feedback, and understand community needs.
Thought Leadership:
Establish XSY as a thought leader in blockchain technology. Share insights, research, and trends that reflect XSY's deep understanding and innovative approach to blockchain ecosystems.
Tactical Steps
Launch Phase:
Begin with a strong launch campaign across all identified platforms, introducing XSY and its mission. Use teaser videos, infographics, and thought leadership articles to generate buzz.
Engagement Phase:
Regularly engage with the audience through AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions, feedback requests, and participation in relevant discussions. Highlight community success stories and testimonials.
Growth Phase:
Use analytics to measure engagement and adjust strategies accordingly. Focus on growing the community by offering valuable content, partnerships announcements, and updates on XSY's progress towards its goals.
Regulatory Considerations and Proof of Concept
Regulatory Transparency:
Regularly communicate any regulatory updates or considerations that impact XSY and its community. This builds trust and positions XSY as a responsible player in the blockchain space.
Proof of Concept Showcasing:
Leverage social media to showcase the development and success of XSY's proof of concept. Highlight how it addresses the challenges in the crypto-economic landscape, such as stability and liquidity issues.
Conclusion
XSY's social media strategy should be as innovative and forward-thinking as its approach to blockchain technology. By focusing on education, community engagement, and thought leadership, XSY can effectively communicate its vision and goals, foster meaningful conversations, and build a strong, engaged community around its projects. The chosen social media channels offer a mix of real-time engagement, professional networking, and in-depth content sharing that aligns with XSY's target audience and strategic objectives.","Which social media platforms are recommended for XSY to effectively reach and engage its target audience of tech-savvy individuals, finance professionals, and blockchain enthusiasts?","Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, Telegram, and YouTube are recommended social media platforms for XSY to effectively reach and engage its target audience of tech-savvy individuals, finance professionals, and blockchain enthusiasts.

Midnight’s delivery timeline for testnets and mainnet
Midnight’s features readiness, availability on testnets, mainnet
Notes
What’s needed from Lace for the glacier drop
Mauricio reviewing this currently right now
Looks like no changes in the dapp bridge to support the drop
A new native token will be created, no new support to Lace
Main requirement for Lace for June is the glacier drop, but according to current information Lace already supports requirements. We need solid confirmation on this, should be confirmed next week.
Current thinking is Lace does not require to support Eth/Btc onboarding for the drop
Documentation summary t
o be developed shared (3 sprints, biweekly sprint)
Every week there will be new chapters to review that will be reviewed
Content of the arch repo is mostly up to date. Native tokens are up to date
Unshielded spec still not available (final)
There is not timeline yet for unshielded in testnet
Action Points
Mauricio to share Glacier drop new document with Lace, this should touch on the UX
Mauricio to confirm drop wallet requirements next week
Abel to schedule a meeting next week (Tuesday) to review the UX for shielded ledger

Notes
Glacier drop to start on July, and for Lace is not a requirement to support Midnight, since the drop happens on Cardano
UX for glacier drop in progress on Midnight side, the current thesis is that Eth/Btc maxis won’t bring their keys to other wallet
There should be some results next week
Right now no timeline for documentation. Timeline will be provided next Thur.
Midnight is aiming to provide something like
https://docs.sui.io/
Piotr to send Andrzej github handles to provide access to private repos
There are architecture documents within the repo which could be the first step for Lace to understand scope
The idea is to have a collaboration dynamics where Midnight provide resources and Lace provides feedback on them, till matching expectations
Lace is the beta wallet partner for Midnight, and the goal is to build enough documentation so next wallet has an easy and comprehensive path
Action Points
Abel to:
Schedule a weekly starting next Thu. And for next week:
Provide timeline on documentation
Check/sync on existing repo documentation
Touchbase on glacier drop or other relevant dates
Schedule UX meeting
Piotr to give github handles to Andrzej","What is the current status of Lace's support for the Glacier Drop and its associated requirements, and when can solid confirmation be expected?","The current status of Lace's support for the Glacier Drop and its associated requirements is that Lace already supports the requirements, but solid confirmation is expected next week."

Introducing XSY (pronounced ‘eksy’). XSY’s mission is to create capital efficient systems that don’t encumber more assets in collateral than they unlock in value. Welcome to the future of blockchain economies.
In the dynamic world of blockchain, the true essence of economic growth and innovation lies not just in the creation of digital assets but in the strategic acceleration of economic activity. Historically, the approach to blockchain ecosystem development has been akin to the ""Field of Dreams"" - build it and they will come. However, at XSY, we believe in a more nuanced, systemic approach to stimulate economic activity and ensure more predictable outcomes through comprehensive partnerships and capabilities.
The blockchain industry faces a significant challenge: the absence of consistent, universally accepted metrics to assess and understand the economic health and underlying value of blockchain ecosystems. This gap has led to a reliance on inconsistent indicators, fostering a ""number go up, project is good"" mentality that fails to capture the complex realities of these ecosystems.
In response, XSY is committed to redefining value creation in the blockchain space by developing consistent measurements akin to those in traditional financial markets. Our aim is to foster a deeper understanding of blockchain systems and their intrinsic value, ensuring a more stable and inclusive financial future.
Join us on this exciting journey as we work to unlock new possibilities and create a more accessible, efficient, and stable economic future.

How can we make Jira ACs easier to read & use?
we should use the AC Checklist functionality in Jira
each item in a Jira AC checklist has its own mini-status
Proposed rules for usage:
When a Dev creates a PR, set each AC mini-status to '
Ready for Review
' (& ticks the 'All ACs implemented"" checkbox in the Github PR)
When a Tester says “everything is fine”, set each AC mini-status to '
Done

Summary
On
29 Feb 2024
, Thursday, X user
@banjoTheGamer
reported
the apparent loss of funds when using Nami to send Ada to an exchange, instead unintentionally jpegstore.io being sent to another address, in a transaction where he did not use Ada handles.
Banjo’s tweet thread led to the creation of an incident crisis management. Immediately the Lace/Nami team started to investigate possible causes for the issue. By the evening the team had found a few hypotheses and started working on a fix.
On
01 Mar 2024
, Friday, the whole team discussed and reviewed the fix. The crisis committee decided to wait until Monday for a decision.
On
02 Mar 2024
, Saturday,
multiple tweets were being made
reporting losses on Nami when using Ada Handle. Live spaces were created, and the community began to converge on the same conclusion regarding the cause.
Due to the lack of SDETs and QAs available for proper testing, the crisis committee decided to release an
emergency fix
that temporarily
disabled Ada Handle
.
On
04 Mar 2024
and
05 Mar 2024
the team worked on a proper fix and sent it to Charles Morgan to audit it
Impact
Some users suffered loss of funds either due to sending to a script address (without a datum), or the recipient is not an address they do not own.

Root Cause Analysis
Why did the funds get sent to the wrong address?
The UI was not displaying the mismatch between resolved address
Why was there a mismatch in the UI?
How did this impact the initial user if they didn’t “send” to an Ada Handle?
Corrective Action Plan
Disable the Ada Handle integration and ship a version to limit the impact","What was the role of the Ada Handle integration in causing the user's funds to be sent to the wrong address, and how did disabling this integration limit the impact of the issue?","The Ada Handle integration was the cause of the user's funds being sent to the wrong address because the UI was not displaying the mismatch between the resolved address and the intended address. This led to the user unintentionally sending Ada to jpegstore.io instead of the intended exchange. By disabling the Ada Handle integration, the team was able to limit the impact of the issue by preventing further users from experiencing the same problem. This was a temporary solution while the team worked on a proper fix to address the root cause of the issue."

A lot of confusion and curiosity from users on what the full project entails
Twitter wall:
https://wall.famewall.io/xsy-launch
Praise 1: Excitement for XSY and Stablecoin Development
Many users expressed excitement and positive sentiment towards the XSY venture and the potential development of a stablecoin on the Cardano network.
sounds like quite an important venture
This looks very interesting!
Praise 2: Appreciation for Cardano's Ecosystem Growth
Users praised the overall growth and development of the Cardano ecosystem, including the XSY venture and other projects.
""CARDANO HIGHLIGHTS OF THE WEEK! 📰\n\n- @xsy_fi : Stablecoin Venture By @InputOutputHK""
""As #crypto prices continue to surge, #Cardano is emergnig as a leader, with big developments in the ecosystem! From the Edinburgh decentralization index to @xsy_fi's stablecoin venture and the onboarding of F11 projects, there's a ton of updates! Tune in!""
Concern 1: Lack of Clarity and Understanding
Some users expressed confusion and a lack of understanding regarding the XSY venture and its offerings.
Amazing but can you explain like I’m 5 ? I don’t understand what this is…
What is this Built on
Concern 2: Criticism of Marketing Language
Some users criticized the use of marketing language in the XSY announcement, expressing a preference for more straightforward and technical explanations.
""@wsford @xsy_fi @IOHKMedia @IOHK_Charles @InputOutputHK sounds like a lot of marketing gibberish to be honest""
""Wow, appreciate this explanation. I didn't get that from the post. Honestly the enterprise marketing terms just blur the lines of what is being built and remove my excitement. Maybe it's just me, but I'm genuinely massively excited about this kind of development, ""","What improvements can be made to the clarity and marketing language of XSY project communications, based on user feedback and sentiment analysis following the soft launch?","To improve the clarity and marketing language of XSY project communications, the following steps can be taken based on user feedback and sentiment analysis:

1. Provide simpler explanations: Users have expressed confusion and a lack of understanding regarding the XSY venture. To address this, communications should include simpler explanations of the project, its offerings, and how it works.

2. Avoid marketing language: Some users have criticized the use of marketing language in the XSY announcement, expressing a preference for more straightforward and technical explanations. To address this, communications should avoid marketing jargon and use clear, concise language that accurately describes the project.

3. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as diagrams, flowcharts, and infographics can help users better understand complex concepts and technologies. Including these in communications can improve clarity and understanding.

4. Engage with the community: Engaging with the community and responding to user feedback can help identify areas where communications can be improved. This can be done through social media, forums, and other online platforms where the Cardano community is active.

"Background
Came out of this meeting:
https://input-output.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CWT/pages/4163141643/2024-02-21+Yellow+Deployment+Retro#Next-Steps
Attendees
Berno, Gytis, Michal, Daniele, Piotr, Martynas, Tomas, Jon
Jon’s Notes
Gytis
move deployment code to a new B/E code repo
automate deployments with CI
Piotr
Cardano JS SDK code will *also* need to be moved to this new B/E repo
Daniele
let's focus on creating a CD process first
moving client side code is a *subsequent* step
Gytis
it's mostly a monolithic B/E right now, so moving *this* would make a big difference
Daniele
let's talk ENVIRONMENTS
we need a CI flow on pushing a commit to deploy on DEV envs, ie Continuous Deployment
we need a button to deploy with version number considered stable on LIVE envs
Gytis
for dev-preview....
for dev-preprod we should indeed have Continuous Deployment
Michal
if dev-preview is currently automatic, why do we have to move code to make dev-preview work?
Piotr
we have a change, we merge it, CD automatically deploys to preprod
at the same time there's a PR executing E2E tests on the same prepod env
if there's a failure, we don't know what caused it
Gytis
let's have *shared* dev-preprod (non-continuously deployed from Master via button clicks in Github)
LIVE envs are *always* deployed via button clicks, for safety
we create ad hocs envs on button click for merge requests (these are extra work for SRE)
dev-preprod *is* the QA env
Daniele
we should have continuous deployment in dev-.... , dev-....., dev-....
as well you need a stable QA env where you can run 48hrs of tests
always before I've had i) Dev ii) QA iii) Prod envs
Berno
dev-preview already has continuous deployment (ie automatically, on commit)
dev-preprod would be continuous delivery, ie a human button-click required (because eg QA might be happening there, it's shared)
LIVE is also button click but with fewer authorised clickers
Daniele
we should have continuous deployment on dev-preprod too, this should *not* be ""our QA env""
we need continuous deployment on 3 networks (1. dev-preview 2. dev-preprod 3. Mainnet), cos they all have different data. I need to see immediately the effect of my changes on Mainnet.
we do not use ""preprod"" because we have a NETWORK called ""preprod""
the usual names are Dev, QA/PreProd, Production
we need a matrix of NETWORK x ENVIRONMENT (env-nets? net-envs?)
dev-preview
dev-preprod
dev-mainnet
qa-preview
qa-preprod
qa-mainnet
live-preview
live-preprod
live-mainnet
purpose of live-preprod is to let the dev debug
purpose of qa-preprod is to run (potentially lengthy) tests
Berno
we would need to construct a business case for the costs here
lower envs can have slower (cheaper) disks
why not just shut things down when not in use? Cos nodes that take a week to sync are on the expensive disks :-(
Gytis
## Stage 1 Option 1 (Could be implemented easily within a week)
dev-preview - continuously deployed from `master`
dev-preprod - deployed with manual CI execution
dev-mainnet - deployed with manual CI execution
<no extra infra cost>
### Stage 1 Option 2:
continuous-preview - continuously deployed from `master`
continuous-preprod - continuously deployed from `master`
dev-preview - deployed with manual CI execution
dev-preprod - deployed with manual CI execution
dev-mainnet - deployed with manual CI execution
<extra cost but not much, these are cheap, except for mainnet, which is why it's not duplicated>
# Stage 2 (Some extra time is required after stage 1)
Environments created with CI for dev-{preview,preprod} and possibly partial for dev-mainnet
Daniele
I'm running a full Cardano stack on my own hardware, 2-yr-old $5K machine
do we really need to spend much on dev envs?
Berno
it's concurrent reads on Mainnet that's the problem with AWS
you need SSD reading speeds and that's very expensive, it's a cloud scam!
Gytis
ad-hoc envs for Mainnet? Way cheaper to send QAs to their own machine, this will pay off in 2 months
Gytis
Step 0
Give infra team a green flag to merge deployments code to XYZ repo (ie doing for dev-preprod what we already do for dev-preview)
***Martynas gave this green flag in the meeting, and Jon considers that this is sufficient authority***
Ticket 1
dev-preprod: Move deployments code to XYZ repo
Ticket 2
dev-preprod: Add deployments CI/CD
Ticket 3
dev-mainnet: Move deployments code to XYZ repo
Ticket 4
dev-mainnet: Add deployments CI/CD
Ticket 5
dev-preview: Refactor deployments code to XYZ repo
Ticket 6
dev-preview: Refactor deployments CI/CD

Logging:
when we look at the logs in Grafana it’s not always easy to find a specific env, the first page of logs is 90% useless & you have to click a lot
some info in each log line is hard to parse, eg json, needs pasting into decoding tools to read them properly
Can solve some of this with knowledge-sharing? see

Pipeline:
add checkboxes to all pipelines so you can deploy from a PR
deployment of live envs (to discuss next time)
TODO:
Jon
to set up demo of pre-prod pipeline with i) anyone from the Infra team ii) Daniele/Martynas/Piotr/Szymon","""How should the deployment code and environments be organized and automated according to the insights from the Yellow Deployment Retro meeting?""","The deployment code and environments should be organized and automated as follows:

        - The deployment code should be moved to a new backend code repository.
        - The Cardano JS SDK code will also need to be moved to this new backend repository.
        - The deployment process should be automated with CI.
        - The focus should be on creating a CD process first, with moving client-side code being a subsequent step.
        - There should be a CI flow on pushing a commit to deploy on dev environments, i.e. Continuous Deployment.
        - There should be a button to deploy with a version number considered stable on live environments.
        - There should be shared dev-preprod environments.
        - Live environments should always be deployed via button clicks for safety.
        - Ad hoc envs should be created on button click for merge requests.
        - There should be continuous deployment on 3 networks (dev-preview, dev-preprod, and Mainnet) so that the effect of changes can be seen immediately on Mainnet.
        - There should be a matrix of network x environments (env-nets or net-envs) with the following combinations: dev-preview, dev-preprod, dev-mainnet, qa-preview, qa-preprod, qa-mainnet, live-preview, live-preprod, and live-mainnet.
        - The purpose of live-preprod is to let the dev debug, and the purpose of qa-preprod is to run potentially lengthy tests.
        - The infra team should be given a green flag to merge deployments code to the XYZ repo for dev-preprod.
        - Tickets should be created for moving deployments code to the XYZ repo, adding deployments CI/CD, and refactoring deployments code and CI/CD for dev-preview, dev-preprod, and dev-mainnet.
        - Michal should be integrated into this process.
        - The PRs should be approved by the appropriate team members.
        - The lace-ops code should be copied, not the dev-preview code.
        - Logging issues should be addressed by setting up a chat of Gytis, Daniele, and Berno to dig into problems and possible responses, and by improving the logging in Grafana.
        - Checkboxes should be added to all pipelines so that deployment can be done from a PR.
        - The deployment of live envs should be discussed in the future."

Ask tribe leadership to communicate decisions that have been made to the whole tribe and present POCs for Q&A whenever a big architectural decision is being made-
Tomas Peycere
Each ticket has to have a signoff from Product, Engineering, and QA before moving to R4D.  Schedule a 3 amigos meeting for that -

Additionally, the squad can investigate the possibility of adding an ""in Design"" status before R4D, either by adding a new column or including the status in the Refining column. This will help clarify the design status of tickets and ensure that they are properly reviewed and addressed before moving to the R4D stage."

"Follow-on from
2024-02-23 Deployment Improvement Gang
Current pipeline work
Pre-prod pipelines are nearly done (
), what’s next?
TODO
:
Jon
to set up demo of pre-prod pipeline with i) anyone from the Infra team ii) Daniele/Martynas/Piotr/Szymon
scheduled for
11 Mar 2024
now a follow-up needed on
14 Mar 2024
Processor issues?
This is being worked on:
Logging?
when we look at the logs in Grafana it’s not always easy to find a specific env, the first page of logs is 90% useless & you have to click a lot
some info in each log line is hard to parse, eg json, needs pasting into decoding tools to read them properly
Can solve some of this with knowledge-sharing? see
https://github.com/input-output-hk/lace-ops?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use-grafana
TODO
:
Jon
to set up chat of Gytis, Daniele, Berno to dig into problems & possible responses
scheduled for
11 Mar 2024
see
2024-03-11 Logging Improvements meet
Next Pipeline work?
Gytis:
we could add checkboxes to all pipelines
so you can deploy from a PR
Perhaps we should move on to deployment of
live
envs?
TODO
: discuss next time",What is the proposed solution for improving the readability of log information in Grafana and the schedule for discussing deployment of live environments?,"The proposed solution for improving the readability of log information in Grafana is to address the issues of finding specific environments and decoding log lines. This can be partially solved through knowledge-sharing, as mentioned in the context, with a link to a GitHub repository that provides information on how to use Grafana. Specifically, a chat has been scheduled for 11th March 2024 between Gytis, Daniele, and Berno to dig into the problems and possible responses.
        
        The schedule for discussing deployment of live environments is not explicitly stated in the context, but it is mentioned that it should be discussed next time. Therefore, it can be inferred that the discussion will take place in the following meeting or gathering, but the exact date and time are not provided."

Conclusion:
The
unique users, as well as the SEO generated users have dropped since our organic content is inexistent for this month;
We notice a spike in unique users on 2nd February (208), followed by 19th February (191). I can’t identify any events to correlate with these occurrences. These website visitors seem to be ‘new’.
This month, new (1,834) versus returning (121) are both in a slight decrease;
The best referring domain is direct, followed by Google, and Nami website;
Lace.io
website visitors prefer our homepage, then the features page, and FAQs;
The
most successful campaign is the Nami banner on our homepage,
and the most successful content is still the Nami acquisition blog post on
Lace.io
blog;
Out of 2,078 unique users, 618 (25%) people visited
lace.io
from their mobiles,
indicating a slight increase;
Out of 2,078 unique users, 556 clicked on ‘Add to browser' button, resulting in a conversion rate of 37.12%
The biggest traffic comes from
USA, followed by Indonesia, Canada and Australia

Conclusion:
Data from the
Google Store dashboard
is not updated since 3rd February, hence it looks like Lace only had
122 installs and 59 uninstalls
, resulting in a
churn rate of 48.36%; This data is not accurate as it’s missing most of the month;
From PostHog analytics we can identify a spike in the daily active users (DAU) on 15th February - 752; The average of DAU is 139.86;
Weekly active users averages at 1,742 users;
The number of unique users is still not clear, since we can see two different numbers in PostHog. One figure is saying 4,056 uniques this month, while the other graph (which also takes into account the country of these unique users) mentions 4,258.
Though February is a shorter month the difference between the previous month and the current is only -2.8%;
The number of sent tokens (including NFTs) has decreased by 28% since the previous month, resulting in 1,078 sent assets;
Overall, Lace seems to have a high amount of dormant users. We need to identify ways to engage these users and transform them into at least resurrecting users. Also, same scenario is revealed from the Cohort analysis;
The highest amount of sent tokens actions is recorded on 29th February, which is when the Nami ADA Handles bug peaked;
This month we registered
158 new wallets
, a 7.6% decrease from the previous month, most being created on 1st and 2nd February,
coinciding with the first Nami incident
;
The number of
connected hardware wallets is 133,
a 15% increase since January. 7th Feb is the day most HW were connected;
385 restored wallets in February
, an increase of 4.62% from the previous month, most being restored on 20th February;
The onboarding process for a
new wallet
shows that the highest drop off is registered when users are asked to insert their first batch of the recovery phrase, followed by when they are asked to set up a wallet password:
327 people who started the onboarding process
11 dropped off, 3316 continued to set up their ‘wallet name’
21 people dropped off, 295 continued to set up their ‘wallet password’
3 people dropped off, 292 continued to the recovery phrase intro screen
13 persons dropped off, 279 continued to write down the first batch of their recovery phrase
2 people dropped off, 277 continued to write down the second batch of their recovery phrase
2 persons dropped off, 275 continued to write down the third batch of their recovery phrase
28 people dropped off, 247 continued to insert the first batch of their recovery phrase
2 persons dropped off, 245 continued to insert the second batch of their recovery phrase
4 persons dropped off, 241 continued to insert the third batch of their recovery phrase and completed the onboarding process
86 people did not open their wallet straight away
The number of sent tokens decreased by 48%
compared to the previous month - 1,459 actions currently vs 2,820 previously
From the
daily active users (DAU) the most active days were 3rd, 10th, 25th;

19,372","""What factors may have contributed to the spike in unique website visitors on February 2nd and 19th, as well as the decrease in new and returning users this month, based on the website metrics provided?""","Factors that may have contributed to the spike in unique website visitors on February 2nd and 19th include the possibility of a successful marketing campaign or promotion on those days, or an external event or news article that drove traffic to the website. However, without further information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of these spikes.

The decrease in new and returning users this month could be due to a lack of organic content or a decrease in marketing efforts, resulting in fewer visitors to the website. Additionally, the use of ad blockers or a decrease in the acceptance of cookies on the website could also contribute to a decrease in tracked users. The missing data from February 25-27 and the limited data from the Google Store dashboard may also impact the accuracy of these metrics."
"Pre DoD work
Product Lead drives the presentation of the following data to Sr Management:
elevator pitch
the source of the idea/request
the results of any Product Discovery that has been done
the Success Criteria that will be measure to prove the Outcomes have been achieved
a statement of ‘Hypothesis Confidence’ (ie how sure are you, that if we build the thing in the elevator pitch, those Success Criteria
will
be achieved)
Writing the DoD #1 - Exec Summary
The pre-DoD steps should already have provided information for the Exec Summary
Writing the DoD #2 - Overall Project
Product Lead drives the creation of high-level scope
of the overall project
(including what is
out
of scope). This should explain:
what user personas are involved
what changes each user personas will experience
how these changes will lead to achieving the Success Criteria
Tech Lead reviews; when happy, they add (similarly high-level) implementation steps
Size estimate: at this stage the only size estimate that can be supplied is probably a crude t-shirt sizing (and/or you may wish to run some Spike(s) to reduce uncertainty)
Depending on the project, this
may
be the point to present back to Sr Management for feedback
Writing the DoD #3 - Phases
For anything other than small projects, the project is broken down into smaller phases.
This is to avoid the Waterfall anti-pattern of “you don’t even
plan
to get any value until you’ve finished the
entire
thing, and often that value turns out to be zero, so you’ve wasted all the effort”. Instead you should be trying to deliver value incrementally as you go.
This phasing also gives the opportunity to decision-makers to cut scope: “you know what? We’re gonna stop at phase 3, we might return to phase 4 later, phase 5 I don’t think we’re
ever
gonna do”
For each phase
, take the process above for the overall scope and apply it iteratively to each phase, such that you end up with the following for each phase:
agreed scope
user personas affected
the changes each persona will experience
how these changes will lead to achieving which Success Criteria
the ideal is that
every phase produces measurable achievement of at least some of the project’s overall Success Criteria
if a phase is a pure technical enabler or PoC, then the DoD should state
what this phase now enables
: a possible format is
After phase XX, as a .., I will be able to …
Tech Lead reviews; when happy, they add implementation steps for each phase
Size estimate: at this stage the only size estimate that can be supplied is probably a crude t-shirt sizing (and/or you may wish to run some Spike(s) to reduce uncertainty)
Depending on the project, this
may
be the point to present back to Sr Management for feedback
Getting to a Size Estimate in ‘ticket counts’
So in some temporary document (Miro? GDocs? Confluence? Spreadsheet?) write down:
the Story Tickets, in proposed
order of delivery
the enabling Task tickets added
…ending up with a nested list:
Phase 1
Story A
Task A1
Task A2
Task A3
Task A4
Story B
Task B1
Task B2
Phase 2
Story C
Task C1
Task C2
This would give us an Initial Ticket Count (ITC) of:
Phase 1: 8 tickets (2 x Story, 6 x Task)
Phase 2: 3 tickets (1 x Story, 2 x Task)
This then needs to be scaled to give a MAX/MIN for the
completion
of each phase
If you have no better idea about how to do this, use this
Default suggestion
:
add 30% to the ITC for the MIN, triple the ITC for the MAX
This gives:
Phase 1:         MIN 10, MAX 24
Phase 2:         MIN  4, MAX  9
Project overall: MIN 14, MAX 33
Putting this into Jira
How
to map phases into Jira? Map a
project phase
(which is, ideally, an
Independently Releasable Thing That Will Realise Some Value
) onto an
Epic
When
to create these tickets? Do
not
create all the Epics or their children in Jira up front
This will ruin the signal-noise ratio of the LW project!
INSTEAD
Only
start
putting into the LW project
Epics/children which have been officially forecast to start their build phase in the next
3
months

out

Multi-wallet/ multi-account
MVP
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Adding multi-wallet and multi-account support is a table stakes feature, with some users not able to switch to Lace due to our current deficit, and others quickly churning after onboarding
Scope: Multiple wallets
Users can add (create/restore/pair) multiple Cardano wallets
Users can seamlessly switch between different wallets
Users can easily see the current wallet’s name
Users can remove a wallet without affecting the other ones
Scope: Multiple accounts
Users can enable/disable additional accounts on existing wallets
Users can easily see the current account’s name (and where it’s nested)
Users can switch between accounts.

Relative Effort Ratios - a basic algorithm
Let’s assume that “Developer Availability” is the sole constraint to consider (a massive simplification but hey, gives us something to work with)
We want to
saturate
work according to priorities
Let’s say that Squad X has 6 devs. How many projects can it work on, and what’s the Relative Effort Ratio of these projects?
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio 1?”. Let’s say that’s
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio 2?”. Let’s say that’s
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio
3
?”. Let’s say that’s
. But actually there’s only
dev left anyway
This Squad can work on 3 Projects simultaneously, and Relative Effort Ratios between those Projects are as follows:
Project Prio 1:
Project Prio 2:
Project Prio 3:
But wait - we do
not
assume that we
only work on ‘Projects’, there’s always some Non-Project Work to do (production bugs, misc tweaks here & there…).
How do we work
this
out?
Do a Jira Query over the last x months, get all your Resolved Tickets, and categorise them by Epic
Sort those Resolved Tickets into two buckets: 1)
Epics that represent your Prioritised Projects,
2)
Non-Project Work
Let’s imagine that there are
35
tickets in Project Bucket #1,
23
tickets in the Non-Project Bucket #2. This is a
ratio of 60:40
Let’s derive from that data that
60%
of the effort of this Squad goes into Project work, while
40%
goes into Non-Project Work
The overall Relative Effort Ratios for this Squad is therefore:
Project Prio 1:
Project Prio 2:
Project Prio 3:
Non-Project Work:","What is the overall Relative Effort Ratio for a squad with six developers, working on three projects simultaneously while also dedicating 60% of their effort to project work and 40% to non-project work?","The overall Relative Effort Ratios for this Squad is therefore:

"You cannot call a ticket R4D unless you have good answers to these questions:
What’s the entire feature/flow? How does this ticket fit in?
What value does this work deliver? Is there some way to deliver
more
value / deliver value with
less
effort?
How are we gonna test this?
What’s the status of the designs? Is it
ready
? How much is it gonna change?
Do we have all these components in Storybook? If not, what’s the effort to do that?
What data fields do we need? Where does that data come from?
How big is this ticket? Should we split it up? Or just do less work and ship value more incrementally?
Perhaps we should reintroduce a Ticket Estimation process to force this ^^ discussion… and The Thing That Is Estimated will be “all the ACs”","Given the context, a suitable question to ask could be:

""What is the necessary data, design readiness, testing approach, and potential impact of implementing the R4D ticket, and should it be split up or delivered incrementally with the current components in Storybook?""","What is the necessary data, design readiness, testing approach, and potential impact of implementing the R4D ticket, and should it be split up or delivered incrementally with the current components in Storybook?

To answer this question, we would need to gather information on the following:

1. Necessary data: What data fields are required for this ticket? Where does this data come from?
2. Design readiness: Is the design for this ticket ready? How much is it expected to change?
3. Testing approach: How will we test this ticket? What kind of testing is required (unit, integration, end-to-end)?
4. Potential impact: What value does this work deliver? Is there a way to deliver more value with less effort?
5. Storybook components: Do we have all the necessary components in Storybook? If not, what is the effort required to add them?
6. Ticket size: How big is this ticket? Should it be split up or delivered incrementally?

By gathering this information, we can make an informed decision about whether to proceed with implementing the R4D ticket, and if so, how to approach it in a way that maximizes value and minimizes effort. It may be beneficial to reintroduce a ticket estimation process to facilitate this discussion and ensure that all relevant factors are considered."
"Topic
: what can we learn from
History
:
true, this ticket didn’t have proper refinement
at the beginning the scope was much less
as we developed it we kept adding stuff
when we started it wasn’t obvious
During Refinement/Project Scoping/(even during dev!): Always ask
where is the value here, is there some way we can ship
some
value
sooner
?
Beware of tickets-that-are-too-big (for the future: would some kinda estimation help?). Use
AC Count
as a heuristic (& possibly split tickets as a result)?
A Dev perspective
I remember being in some refinement meets
we spoke about some screens
lightly touched on the data
then Xmas break, in Jan it was R4D
a couple of days later in a DS I realised another ticket-in-progress had info that I needed
was split out
ticket was too large
we should have said “this has been on the board two weeks, let’s do refinement again”, instead we continued the original way
we
now
have created tools that SDETs need to do the testing eg
and
were Testers involved in declaring this ticket R4D? Did they check that we know how to test this ticket?
Make ACs low-level & unambiguous
Make sure it is agreed How We Test This for a ticket to be called R4D
I was developing, realised that the design didn’t deal with a scenario
Feature Flags
Split into smaller tickets? Yes, if we had put everything under a feature flag, we could have developed in parallel
Order of development
build the screen when you have the data available
OR
We can start working on the UI first, without data/logic connections, just use dummy data in Storybook
Refinement
I often ask questions in refinement… shouldn’t be R4D until the tech specs are clear & familiar to everyone
We need to focus more on the
data
and where we get it from
Put in the ticket: “Pull from this API… the data is available here….”
Checklist? Even a flow diagram to govern Refinement?
We often start at “here is the Flow, let’s talk implementation”. Can we go one step back and talk about the feature itself, what value it provides, where we get the data from…

this
was
split into UX work and data work
everything was faked behind a feature flag for Renan/Dominik
1 month
later
the data was ready
maybe this was easier
because
it was new? Contrast:
Tx Rep
was a refactor of an
existing
feature
For
Tx Rep
we could have made more use of Storybook up front? This is not inside Lace, should be much faster than Lace, but for Tx Rep it
wasn’t
, cos many of those components were not already in Storybook
Possible rule:
every
component should be in Storybook
The state of the Lace codebase is such that you have to massively clean an
existing
component up before porting it into Storybook. For a new
What would
prove
to a FE dev that the data is available and can easily be pulled into a UI skeleton?
some kinda spike which puts the data onto a web page! (if SDK/Lace devs
paired
on this then there’d be good Knowledge Sharing)
and/or
Swagger
(but this means there’s less
learning
)
Do we fully onboard people who will be working on a feature? Are the right people in the room right at the start?
We are Lace & SDK engineers
Martynas would be the most knowledgeable person, but there’s only one of him
How are we going to share knowledge?
Start with twin track spikes:
UI side
: get all of the components into Storybook (or prove that this is a truly horrible job - in which case, introduce a Feature Toggle and start anew in Storybook)
Data side
: get all the data items onto some unstyled web page (as appropriate, via SDK Dev / Lace Dev pairing)
Data
often the BE data is very low-level, needs to be transformed to be useful to the user
I think an index of all available data from the providers woudn't be sufficient for tx representation tasks. You need to understand the underlying Cardano transactions model well, then figure out how to map/compute/derive the data you need in the UI
Knowledge Sharing:
start with a review of what we have, and list our knowledge gaps
Idea: we all record a video a week (Daniele style) where we explain something useful in our day-to-day work, publish them on lace-dev channel eg how to use Chromatic, do sth in Storybook, how to set up & run local testnet

Pairing to break down the SDK/Lace barrier","How can a focus on value, data, and refinement during ticket development, along with effective knowledge sharing and communication, contribute to managing scope, improving testing, and addressing challenges in building user interfaces and integrating data in the Lace codebase?","A focus on value, data, and refinement during ticket development can help manage scope, improve testing, and address challenges in building user interfaces and integrating data in the Lace codebase. By asking where the value is and looking for ways to ship value sooner, teams can avoid creating tickets that are too big and ensure that they are delivering features that provide real value to users.
        
        During refinement and project scoping, it's important to consider the data that will be needed to build the feature and where it will come from. By clearly defining the data requirements and how it will be obtained, teams can avoid delays and ensure that they have everything they need to build the feature.
        
        Effective knowledge sharing and communication can also play a key role in managing scope and addressing challenges in the Lace codebase. By ensuring that the right people are involved in refinement and development from the start, teams can leverage the knowledge and expertise of all team members to build features more effectively.
        
        Tools like AC Count can be used as a heuristic to help manage scope and ensure that tickets are not too big. Additionally, starting with a very bare spike can help teams better understand the requirements and challenges of a feature before diving into development.
        
        When it comes to building user interfaces and integrating data, it's important to build the screen when the data is available and to consider using feature flags to enable parallel development. Additionally, starting with the UI first, without data or logic connections, can help teams build the UI more quickly and efficiently.
        
        Finally, versioning figma and pairing to break down the SDK/Lace barrier can help ensure that teams are working together effectively and that knowledge is being shared across the team. By focusing on these key areas, teams can manage scope, improve testing, and address challenges in building user interfaces and integrating data in the Lace codebase."

"Releasing squad:
Blorange
Release tech lead:
Piotr Czeglik
Steps
Preparation stage
1. 💬 Create a Slack channel using a name like this
#tmp-lace-release-1-9
(here and below we use version 1.6.0 as an example)
a. Invite all relevant people like scrum-masters involved, tech-lead, your squad obviously, people from the mark/comm’s team like
Teodora Sevastru
,
Rodolpho Ribeiro
as the community manager,
Lukasz Jagiela
for QA oversight and our release manager
Laurence Jenkins
announcing the new coming release.
2. Create a new paragraph entry on the page:
Release / Lace Browser
with the new release following the previous release-entries
3. Create a Readiness checklist (
Lace Browser - V.1.6
as an example)
4. A week
before
the release publishing day, a new release branch needs to be created:
a.
git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b release/extension/1.8.x
(for version 1.8.0)
b. 🤔 Why is it called
release/extension/1.8.x
with an
x
at the end?
When it comes to releasing a hotfix (for instance 1.8.1), you'd prefer to have
minimal changes with just the necessary fixes
. Creating a new release-branch from main could introduce unrelated changes that you wouldn't necessarily want in your hotfix. So every hotfix will use the original same release branch.
c. Bump the version of the
package.json
in
apps/browser-extension-wallet/package.json
to
1.8.0
d. Bump the version of the
manifest
in
apps/browser-extension-wallet/manifest.json
to
1.8.0
5. 🔎 Please ensure that all automated tests are executed on the new release branch normally always executed on every commit on the release branch
release/extension/1.8.x
.
This will take 1–2 hours to finish
Regression stage
8. 🏁 You let your squad-QA start with the manual-regression tests
9. If you find issues, the official process for fixing it will be:
a. create a branch from
main
where the fix is going to be applied,
b. create a PR which has
main
as destination
c. after passing the ""definition of done"" merge it into
main
d. perform a git-cherry-pick of the merged fix and apply it on your release branch
release/extension/1.8.x
10. If no issues were found, let the QA team of your squad create a test report which should include in the
Release / Lace Browser
11. Prepare assets: any change, which happens on the release branch, will generate a new “asset” or artifacts called
lace.zip
. You find it in the release PR -> Checks -> CI -> on the bottom you:
a. Download
lace.zip
b. Rename it to
lace-chrome-extension@1.8.0.zip
c. Create a duplicate for Edge, extract it, edit the
manifest.json
and remove the property and value of
key
on that JSON file and save it. (Somehow, Edge store does not like that key property 🤷‍♂️)
d. Zip it, I use the command
zip ../lace-edge-extension@1.8.0.zip -r *
e. When you have both files,
lace-chrome-extension@1.8.0.zip
and
lace-edge-extension@1.7.0.zip
add them under Assets in the
Release / Lace Browser
Publishing/post-release phase
12. Let stakeholders decide for a go/no-go for the release and if yes inform
Laurence Jenkins
for submission to each respective stores.
13. After the release has been published, you need to create a git tag
a. Run on that release branch:
git tag -a lace-extension@1.8.0 -m ""Lace browser extension v1.8.0 release""
git push --tags
14. Create a new release based on the newly created tag in lace GitHub
https://github.com/input-output-hk/lace/releases
15. Finally, when the new version is on the store you will need to cherry-pick the commit(s), which were involved in steps: 3c, 3d and 3e (package.json, manifest bump and release notes) to be applied on
main
branch.
16. When cherry-picking, ensure that the
PRODUCTION_MODE_TRACKING
environment variable is set to false on
main
.","Why is the naming convention for the release branch called 'release/extension/1.8.x' with an 'x' at the end, and what is the purpose of creating a release branch with minimal changes for hotfixes?","The naming convention for the release branch 'release/extension/1.8.x' with an 'x' at the end is used to indicate that every hotfix will use the original same release branch. This is done to minimize changes with just the necessary fixes in the hotfix, and avoid introducing unrelated changes that may not be desired. By using the same release branch for hotfixes, the team can ensure that the hotfix only includes the necessary changes and not any unrelated ones. This approach helps maintain the integrity and stability of the codebase, and makes it easier to track and manage hotfixes."

The primary feature is a deprecation warning alongside the migration tool, allowing users to migrate their data to Lace with a single click. The tool is built in a separate codebase, allowing Nami to be deprecated in the future. The scope of this phase includes migrating data such as wallets and their accounts, active account pointer, whitelisted sites, active network, and collateral pointers. Automated e2e tests will also be implemented.

However, there are also limitations to this phase. Granular control over what gets migrated is not included in the scope. Additionally, the Nami theme/mode/etc. is considered out of scope for this phase. Implementation notes for this phase include potential risks and dependencies associated with working on Nami’s codebase, as well as the need to create tasks for setting currency preference in Lace, setting collateral per network, hiding the show recovery phrase, and enabling analytics.

In summary, the first phase of the Nami Migration Tool provides users with the ability to migrate their data to Lace with a single click, while also including some limitations such as the lack of granular control over migration and exclusion of Nami theme/mode. Implementation notes highlight potential risks and dependencies associated with working on Nami’s codebase, as well as the need to create tasks for additional features and functionalities."

Messaging
XSY, the new Stablecoin venture from IOG, steps in as the new leadership for Lace and Djed;
This is a strategic step towards achieving adoption and growth, or as we call it, the Liquidity Operating System;
XSY is assembling the right capabilities to take a principled and systematic approach towards achieving two key things for a blockchain ecosystem, by trying to accelerate:
economic activity (EA)
and monetary velocity (MV)
With the new leadership, Lace has ramped up its technical capabilities and started to deliver more value to its users.
Djed and Lace represent the medium of exchange and the distribution channel, the first components in XSY’s pipeline to support its vision of transforming the exchange of value and empower humanity.

Context
A feature is being improved over a number of individual steps, involving a number of engineers, where incremental changes is not desired.
The main branch
could
be released at any time
The incremental code integration is not violating the rules around atomic commits, that technically are functional standalone, but the changes are desired to be released together as a single user story.
One option is to maintain a so called “integration branch”, AKA a staging branch, which allows the individual PRs to be merged and integrated with peer contributions, then the complete change merged to the
main
branch when ready to release. Taking this approach requires tedious and ongoing merging of downstream changes to avoid drift with
main
and handle merge conflicts when they’re closer to the origin.
Alternatively, a feature flag can be implemented to selectively build the alternative version so the code can be merged safely to master, then enabled once ready.

A/B testing potential
Disaster recovery rollback
Consistent process
Consequences
Using a feature flag in this scenario may require additional development effort, since there’s effectively two features being maintained concurrently, however targeting the
main
branch reduces the work involved in keeping the staging branch in sync, so this is negligible in most cases.
There’s some risk the added complexity introduces bugs, although this should be mitigated already with the testing strategy.

"What are we adding to this release?
Fix the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68
Per the recommendation of the
pool.pm
team and in compliance with metadata standards, we sometimes see NFT IPFS links represented as arrays of strings. These arrays are meant to be concatenated directly to produce the IPFS link (or data scheme, etc.). Because the image is retrieved in the send assets page, without this change users are UNABLE to send assets in CIP-68 format (since the decimals do not get properly set in
nami/src/api/extension/index.js#1762
.
As it is impacting current minters of NFTs on CIP-68. There is a large collection just minted (Galacticats) where assets are frozen in individuals’ wallets.
Please note the NFT were always accessible by using another wallet, so the users were not completely stuck

After adding a wallet in Nami, it should be possible to opt in and opt out of analytics tracking
It should include an explanation about what we are tracking
A new section called Legal should be added to the top-level Settings page, with the items:
Analytics -
icon and a toggle
Terms of Service - when clicking, it should display the Terms of Service overlay
Privacy Policy - when clicking, it should display the Privacy Policy overlay
When hovering over the

Additionally, an explanation about what is being tracked should be included.
        
        This update will have an impact on the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68. Currently, NFT IPFS links are sometimes represented as arrays of strings, which are meant to be concatenated directly to produce the IPFS link. However, this is not currently being done properly, which is causing issues with the display of NFTs minted on CIP-68. To fix this issue, the Nami wallet should be updated to properly concatenate these arrays to produce the IPFS link. This will allow users to send assets in CIP-68 format and will resolve the issue with frozen assets in individuals’ wallets.
        
        In summary, the Nami wallet should be updated to allow users to opt in and out of analytics tracking and to properly display NFTs minted on CIP-68. These updates will involve adding a new section to the Settings page, updating the handling of NFT IPFS links, and providing an explanation of what is being tracked. Additionally, any existing user data should be removed when opting out of analytics tracking if possible."
"Timeframe: 14th January - 18th February
Executive summary
We’ve implemented PostHog analytics in Nami wallet and website (14th Jan), and we’ll revise the metrics during 14th Jan - 18th Feb 2024;
During this time, we’ve noticed
8,180 active users
, with a
peak of 1,382 DAU on 2nd February
, which coincides with the stir on social media;
https://soquest.xyz/
is one of the top referral domains. This rewards platform
allows just for one Cardano wallet to connect - that is Nami wallet
.
The highest referring traffic comes directly,
followed by an unidentifiable traffic source. I am not sure if this lack of tracking is a bad set up in PostHog or this domain has some blockers that inhibit tracking.
The scenario occurs multiple times.
Most accessed browser is Chrome, and the highest conversion rate at 13.25%
Opera and Samsung Internet
, while having lower access numbers,
show relatively high conversion rates of 9.71% and 10.20%,
respectively, indicating potential niches where users are more likely to convert.
The PostHog analytics also show metrics from ‘Android mobile’ and ‘Facebook Mobile’ as tracked browsers, however, it’s unclear how these are quantified as browsers.
The cohort chart indicates a low engagement in Nami wallet on a weekly basis

Weekly retention of users
From the weekly cohort chart below we can identify very little product usage on a weekly basis","""What insights can be gained from the PostHog analytics of Nami wallet and website regarding user behavior, referral domains, and conversion rates during the timeframe of January 14th to February 18th, 2024, and what are the potential implications for improving user engagement and conversion?""","During the timeframe of January 14th to February 18th, 2024, PostHog analytics were implemented for Nami wallet and website. The analytics revealed that there were 8,180 active users, with a peak of 1,382 daily active users (DAU) on February 2nd. The highest referring traffic came directly, followed by an unidentifiable traffic source, which may indicate a lack of tracking or the use of blockers. The most accessed browser was Chrome, but Opera and Samsung Internet showed relatively high conversion rates of 9.71% and 10.20%, respectively, indicating potential niches where users are more likely to convert.

        The cohort chart showed low engagement in Nami wallet on a weekly basis, with only a small percentage of users returning to the platform. The top referring domains included soquest.xyz, which is a rewards platform that allows only one Cardano wallet to connect - Nami wallet. This suggests that there may be an opportunity to increase user engagement and conversion by partnering with rewards platforms or offering incentives for using Nami wallet.

        The conversion funnels/platform data showed that Chrome had the highest number of pageviews, but also the highest drop-off rate. Safari and Opera, on the other hand, had lower pageviews but higher conversion rates. This suggests that there may be opportunities to optimize the user experience for different browsers to improve conversion rates.

        The analytics also showed that there were metrics from 'Android mobile' and 'Facebook Mobile' as tracked browsers, but it is unclear how these are quantified as browsers. This may indicate a need for further clarification or investigation.

        In summary, the PostHog analytics of Nami wallet and website during the timeframe of January 14th to February 18th, 2024, revealed insights into user behavior, referral domains, and conversion rates. The low engagement on a weekly basis, high drop-off rates for certain browsers, and potential niches for conversion suggest opportunities for improving user engagement and conversion. These insights could be used to inform strategies for optimizing the user experience, partnering with rewards platforms, and offering incentives for using Nami wallet."

Potentials (from Ian):
What do you think about Nami being acquired [maybe insert link]?
(need help with phrasing this one)
Why did you first install Nami? (or, How did you discover Nami)",What unique feature or improvement would current Nami Wallet users like to see in a potential acquisition or collaboration between Nami and Lace wallets?,"Current Nami Wallet users would like to see a unique feature or improvement in a potential acquisition or collaboration between Nami and Lace wallets that enhances their wallet experience. This could include improved interoperability between the two wallets, allowing users to easily switch between them and access their assets on both platforms. Additionally, users may appreciate a more seamless integration with DApps and other blockchain services, as well as enhanced security features and better customer support. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a more user-friendly and versatile wallet experience that meets the needs of Nami Wallet users and attracts new users to the platform."
"In the upcoming Nami user research, we plan to leverage its status as a mature product, allowing us to start with informed assumptions about its users rather than conducting research from zero.
Considerations
Here are the key considerations that informed our assumptions:
Nami, an early light wallet, capitalized on the last bull market
It offers straightforward UX
It’s considered a good wallet for visualizing NFTs
It misses features present in newer wallets like Eternl and Typhon, such as multiple soft wallets, multiple addresses, and, until the last release, could not delegate to other stake pools
Some users don’t understand that it’s possible to use more than one Cardano wallet app for the same wallet, at same time
Assumptions
Based on the aforementioned considerations, here are our main assumptions about Nami wallet users.
Some or many Nami users likely…
…chose Nami early on, when it was one of the few light wallets, or when it was one of the only options for NFT visualization, and stuck to it
…prefer Nami because it has a better NFT visualization than Eternl and other Cardano wallets
…installed Nami during the bull market peak and might not be very active now
…use Nami for specific functions, such as NFT visualization, and other wallets for different activities, like Daedalus for HODL
…appreciate Nami's strong ties to the Cardano community and early support of Cardano features
…might not explore other wallets or advanced features due to a lack of technical knowledge about the Recovery Phrase","What proportion of Nami wallet users likely continue to use Nami due to its early support of Cardano features and strong community ties, as opposed to its NFT visualization capabilities or simplicity?","Based on the context, it is not possible to determine the exact proportion of Nami wallet users who continue to use Nami due to its early support of Cardano features and strong community ties, as opposed to its NFT visualization capabilities or simplicity. However, the context suggests that some Nami users likely appreciate Nami's strong ties to the Cardano community and early support of Cardano features, and that some or many Nami users likely chose Nami early on and stuck to it. Additionally, some Nami users might not explore other wallets or advanced features due to a lack of technical knowledge about the Recovery Phrase. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a significant proportion of Nami wallet users continue to use Nami due to its early support of Cardano features and strong community ties. However, without further research or data, it is impossible to provide a specific numerical value for this proportion."
"In a 2021 survey for Daedalus users, one of the questions was what other wallets they were also using. This is what users who were using the wallet said about it:

quick
its ok
3
dapp connector
3
Smart contracts
Its not daedulus
3
can be used in the testnet
for security reasons
3
cardano wallet
doesnt cooperate fully with deadalus
3
Browser integration
Less / other features than Daedalus
3
quick to use
Quick but it dont give me a sense of security
3
Light Wallet
only use it for NFTs
3
Smart COntracts
Difficult to use and find the information i need
3
smart contracts
still familiarizing myself with nami
3
Instant Access
No staking options.
3
Smart contract integration, nft gallery
Even though I like the fact that I can use nami with smart contracts enabled apps and can view my nft's in there I also think Nami has room for improvement with their user experience.
3
Sundae swap compatibility
Haven't used it too much and I don't feel familiar with it. It's cool how it integrates with the test net.
3
3
ease of use, faster
still not as evolved as metamask
3
nfts and simplicity
good wallet for nfts and sending ada. other then that Daedalus is better
3
Connectivity to Smart contacts
It is easy to use, very lite and fast, though, I am not sure about the level of security, so I keep only small ammounts there.
3
SC integration
slow for purchasing mints
3
Speed
3
DApp
Needs time to improve
3
i can see my NFT's
I only use it because deadalus lacks the feature to see my nft's.
3
Chrome browser extension to interact with CNFT. Able to interact with Cardano web Dapps that support that feature.
I just installed it and don't have much experience using it yet.
3
Easy and quick set up with CNFT marketplaces.
Unsure of secruity of Nami wallet.
3
Integration to SundaeSwap
Not official Cardano wallet
3
Low overhead
It can be/seem slow to register/process transactions
3
Can view Tokens and SCs
Daed seems to be faster and more reliable.
3
NFT viewership and smart contract interactions
I don't really like that it is just a browser extension
3
NFT gallery view and speed
I just opened the wallet. I haven't used Nami yet, so I can't give a fair assessment of Nami yet. It looks good on YouTube and is popular.
3
working much better
it's not a dedicated app, it's only a browser extension
3
Access to sundae Swap
It is much less user friendly
3
dapp compatibility
Browser wallet + compatible with dapps
3
Doesn't make my high spec laptop and PC run at full fan speed when it's open. Better token and NFT management.
See aforementioned answer.

3
browser based
no way to delegate to stake pools easily besides their Berry pool
3
Holding multiple asset types for DEX trading. Integration with web browser.
Its fine.
3
NFT gallery/ease of use
I like the NFT gallery with visuals of NFTs, however, the Nami often locks up when I try to mint a popular project with high volume. No success in my attempts to mint popular projects using Nami.
3
most applications allow it
quick to use but doesn't feel as secure as daedalus
3
Interacts with dapps
very new to the wallet. still getting used to it
3
smart contracts
no need to wait for connection
transactions take too long to send

bored","What are the key strengths and weaknesses of the Nami wallet, as indicated by user feedback and scores in a 2021 survey?","The Nami wallet received high scores for ease of use and accessibility, performance and speed, smart contract and dApp integration, NFT support and visualization, and versatility and features. Users praised the user-friendly interface, simple and quick setup, browser extension, and no need for synchronization. They also appreciated the fast transactions, instant access, and efficient operation without delays. The wallet's comprehensive support for smart contracts, seamless dApp connectivity, and browser integration for web3 experiences were also highlighted. Users found the robust NFT gallery, easy NFT management, and integration with Cardano NFT marketplaces to be strong points. The wallet's multiple accounts, testnet support, and diverse functionalities like token and NFT viewing were also appreciated. The wallet's compatibility with Cardano projects, DEXs, and CNFT platforms showcased a deep integration with the ecosystem.
        
        However, some users expressed concerns over reliability and security, with scores dropping to 3 and below. Users reported limitations in functionalities, such as staking options, multi-UTxO management, or broader wallet features. Occasional slow transactions, errors during high-volume periods, or difficulties with specific dApp interactions were also mentioned. Users called for UI improvements, more intuitive navigation, and additional features to match or exceed competitors. Some users also expressed a desire for further enhancements in integration with more platforms or improved browser support."

"Who provided feedback
Lace Keepers (power users) in Lace Discord channel
When was the feedback given
20 Feb 2024
Feedback
Rodolpho Ribeiro
presented the
mock-up files
kindly provided by
Daniel Smith
to the Lace Keepers on 16 February 2024. Here's their much-appreciated feedback:
Recovering the wallet as it will be implemented looks much better than it is now. For me, it is important to be able to paste all 24 words of the recovery phrase once, not to paste each word individually in its position
An important feature for me is also
the option to lock specific wallets
(ask for the spending password or another unlock password to be able to unlock them) when you have multiple wallets. Eternl had this feature in a previous version, and now it doesn't have it anymore, and I really miss it. it will probably be implemented in a new version of Eternl, I hope Lace will also implement this
When restoring a wallet from the recovery phrase of when connecting a new hardware wallet, for the multi-account feature,
Lace should ask how many accounts to restore
. An even more advanced option (maybe better for some people) would be to allow selecting individual accounts to restore. Eternl has this feature (I'm not sure if it is also when restoring the wallet or only later, but it has the option anytime to restore new accounts, and allows you to select exactly which account to restore)
If the number of accounts to restore is not specified or not an option, and Lace wants to restore multiple accounts,
it should restore the accounts one by one, until it finds the first one never used
,
then stop searching for new accounts to restore automatically
The functionality to paste the seed phrase should be
resilient to different formats
.
The words could be separated by spaces, tabs, returns, … in the user's password safe or text file. They could be uppercase or lowercase. Seed words are unique after the first four letters, so with some metal seed phrase storages you only give the first four letters
At the screen where users choose a name and a spending password: Maybe, there could be a text stating more explicitly that this is a
local
setting not synchronised across devices, can be chosen freely on every import of the seed phrase, does not provide additional security if an adversary has the seed phrase, … That's a common misconception I observe users having
Account selection should be a grid of checkboxes (for both, hardware and seed phrase wallets) because you can (or at least should be able to) have several accounts under the same wallet. Auto-detection cannot be exhaustive. The standard allows
far
too many accounts (2^31 if I remember correctly). But it should probably try until it finds an unused account and then maybe offer three to five more unused accounts (so that the user can start using more)
The
“Something went wrong” dialogue
when pairing a hardware wallet should give some more details on
what
went wrong in user-understandable language. “I did not find a USB device at all.”, “I found a Ledger, but it seems to be locked.”, “The Cardano app does not seem to be open.”, “This is a Ledger, but it is not the one belonging to this wallet.”, … This not only helps the user, but also Support because we do not have to give the whole list of possible problems from faulty USB cables to wrong passphrase accounts, but can be much more specific",How can the resiliency of pasting the seed phrase in Lace be improved to accommodate different formats and separators?,"The resiliency of pasting the seed phrase in Lace can be improved to accommodate different formats and separators by making the functionality case-insensitive and able to recognize various separators such as spaces, tabs, and returns. Additionally, the system should be able to identify unique seed words based on the first four letters, as some metal seed phrase storages only provide the first four letters. This will ensure that users can paste their seed phrases in different formats without encountering any issues."
"Following the
strategic partnership between IOG and Blockfrost
, there’s high level direction to consolidate engineering efforts around a single, in-house, data access product and discontinue what can arguably be seen as competing custom solutions. In order to assess the viability of this strategy, this study will explore:
Lace’s current data requirements.
What has been planned to achieve then required level of scale and efficiency, particularly as it relates to decoupling completely from
cardano-db-sync
.
Other scenarios, including Lace as the UI for a full node desktop application.
A gap analysis with the current Blockfrost API
Potential solutions for closing the gaps, utilising the technology built to deliver the current Lace backend.
Lace initially used Blockfrost for the early of the software development, as a strategy for decoupling the front-end development stream. This achieved the goal but the data requirements were mismatched with the API, and therefore low performance and client-side complexity was experienced.
1. Lace’s current data requirements
The data requirements are broken into 8 interfaces, bounded by expected feasibility for a given source to satisfy each property. Each interface implements a base
Provider
interface
note
These interfaces were developed in the scope of the
cardano-js-sdk
, in an attempt to standardise data access at a more general level. Over time it has become apparent this is influenced by the wallet’s requirements, and is better considered part of the Lace code repository. Code will soon be migrated and potentially refactored, so the provider scoping will not be the focus of this study.

5. Potential Solutions for closing the gaps","""How can the Lace wallet's data requirements be satisfied by the current Blockfrost API, and what modifications or additional features would be necessary to close any identified gaps?""","To satisfy Lace wallet's data requirements using the current Blockfrost API, the following modifications or additional features would be necessary to close identified gaps:

        1. AssetProvider:
            - Implement a new endpoint in Blockfrost to return information on multiple assets at once, or modify the existing endpoint to accept a list of assets and return information on all of them in a single response.
            - Add support for tokenMetadata and nftMetadata in the Blockfrost API response for the getAsset endpoint.
        2. ChainHistoryProvider:
            - Implement new endpoints in Blockfrost to return transactions by addresses and blocks by hashes, similar to the existing transactionsByHashes endpoint.
        3. HandleProvider:
            - Implement a new endpoint in Blockfrost to resolve handles and return HandleResolution information.
            - Implement a new endpoint in Blockfrost to return PolicyId information.
        4. NetworkInfoProvider:
            - Implement new endpoints in Blockfrost to return ledgerTip, protocolParameters, genesisParameters, lovelaceSupply, stake, and eraSummaries information.
        5. RewardsProvider:
            - Implement new endpoints in Blockfrost to return rewardsHistory and rewardAccountBalance information.

        These modifications and additional features would enable the Lace wallet to satisfy its data requirements using the current Blockfrost API, thereby consolidating engineering efforts around a single, in-house, data access product and discontinuing custom solutions."

Biography
Imagine a financial navigator, ""Alex,"" who embodies the essence of Cardano stablecoins. Alex is a savvy investor, deeply invested in the DeFi ecosystem, always searching for stable and secure investment avenues amidst the volatile crypto market. With a keen eye on maintaining value and ensuring liquidity, Alex represents the core attributes of Cardano stablecoins: stability, security, and innovation.
Alex, much like Cardano stablecoins, operates with a principle of balance—aiming to mitigate the rollercoaster rides of cryptocurrency markets by pegging to more stable assets. This persona is not just about preservation but also about progression, exploring how financial operations can evolve on the blockchain to offer more inclusive and accessible financial services. Alex's journey with Cardano stablecoins reflects a commitment to leveraging blockchain technology for creating a more stable, efficient, and transparent financial futur
Professional goals

Sources of information
e.g., Wendy works remotely and has trouble staying in sync with teammates
e.g., Pranav reads the latest business and finance news","How do Cardano stablecoins, as represented by the persona Alex, balance the need for stability and innovation in the decentralized finance ecosystem?","Cardano stablecoins, embodied by the persona Alex, strike a balance between stability and innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by focusing on maintaining value and ensuring liquidity. Alex, as a financial navigator, meticulously searches for secure investment avenues within the volatile crypto market, always aiming to peg stable assets to mitigate market fluctuations.

        This balance is achieved through a few key strategies:

        1. **Stability through pegging**: Cardano stablecoins, like Alex, maintain stability by pegging their value to more stable assets, such as fiat currencies or precious metals. This anchoring mechanism helps to minimize the price volatility associated with traditional cryptocurrencies.

        2. **Innovation through blockchain technology**: Cardano stablecoins leverage blockchain technology to offer more inclusive and accessible financial services. By utilizing the Cardano blockchain, these stablecoins promote a decentralized, transparent, and secure financial ecosystem, enabling users to participate in DeFi applications with greater confidence.

        3. **Exploration of financial operations**: Alex, as a persona, represents the continuous exploration of how financial operations can evolve on the blockchain. Cardano stablecoins follow this principle by constantly researching and implementing new methods to improve financial processes, ensuring a balance between stability and innovation.

        In summary, Cardano stablecoins, as represented by the persona Alex, maintain stability through pegging and innovation through leveraging blockchain technology and continuously exploring financial operations. This balance between stability and innovation allows Cardano stablecoins to offer a more secure and progressive decentralized finance ecosystem for users."

"Epic, Stories and Tasks Management Guidelines
This guideline outlines our approach to managing epics, user stories and tasks, emphasizing the distinction between product requirements and technical tasks. It serves as a guide for product teams and engineers to streamline the development process, ensuring that each user story is tied to a specific functionality, with well defined acceptance criteria that are understandable from a business standpoint, creating alignment between product goals and technical execution.
Initiative-Jira (or single Epic feature)
Initiatives
should clearly define:
Executive summary
Affected products & areas
Target audience
Problem being solved
High-level scope with delivery phases
Each phase has a delivery of value
Risks and dependencies
Risks may be defined at the top level of the initiative or associated to a phase
Expected measurable business outcomes
This information should completely align with the
Definition of Done (DoD) document
, or just reference it
Epic
Each epic must have a clear scope
, that ties to a DoD phase (summarized in the initiative/DoD) and identifiable through the titles of user stories contained
For only-technical work, epics must still contain a summary, problem being solved, high-level scope, and expected outcomes from a developer or infrastructure POV
For maintenance or production
bugs there are generic epics that act as buckets of other tasks that don’t belong to the standard product development
All user-facing functionalities should be captured in user stories
Minor adjustments, such as updating copy or changing styles, may be filed as tasks
The rest of the development work required to achieve the functional requirements defined by the stories, must be filed as tasks which are part of the epic, and which are linked by a
required
dependency to the relevant story
User Story and Required Tasks
User stories capture the functional requirements of a feature. They are directly tied to a user facing functionality and include well-defined acceptance criteria that are understandable from a business perspective
Engineering tasks required to accomplish the story may be optionally created by and for engineers, containing all technical information necessary. This approach provides the engineering team with the flexibility to create tasks optimally, without affecting overall project management. These tasks are always linked to the story they fulfill, being part of the same epic
Benefits:
Easy identification of the epic scope
Clear separation between product requirements (user stories) and technical tasks (tasks)
Enables the possibility to monitoring real progress towards feature release by tracking stories
User Story Structure
Background (optional): Provides context for the story.  If the reasoning is clearly inherited from the epic, it may be omitted
Scope: Describes the core functionality with the format:
""As a [persona],
I want to [action],
so that [outcome].""
Out of Scope (optional): Clearly states what is not included in the story's scope
Platforms:
Specifies the platforms to be addressed (e.g., mobile, desktop)
A refinement session is held once the first definition is ready, and before UI designs are available. Product, Design,
Development
, and QA teams meet to ensure the scope and goals of the story are understood
Extra development tasks required for completing the story are identified, created and linked to the main story, following their own refinement processes within the Engineering team
Acceptance Criteria (AC)
The AC serves as a checklist for QA to verify that a story meets all requirements before it is merged. It is a contract between Product and Engineering teams.
AC statement are defined by the Product team, and any modification or removal on the ticket must be done by the PM/PO
When there are UI designs involved, AC points should be defined/finalized after the designs are ready
Requirements:
Must define all functional points as minimum requirements
Use scenario-based checklists to cover various conditions
Statements should follow the
""Given, When, Then""
format, using abbreviations when needed “
When.., Then..”,
these abbreviations carry the context from the first full statement
When there are many statements sharing the core part of the statement, it’s recommended to highlight (in bold for example) the difference between the statements for QA readability
Process:
After defining the AC, a refinement session is held for final approval. Once approved, the story is ready for execution
R
elease Management
User stories and bugs are assigned a

by the PM/PO for planning purposes, and may be updated as needed depending on priorities and scope changes

Exec Summary
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary (overall project)
This project lays the foundation for efficient development of critical Lace projects, which includes extending the product over multiple platforms (extension, mobile, desktop) and blockchains (Cardano, Midnight, Bitcoin and Ethereum).
Application Architecture
In order to address the multi-chain/multi-platform development, Lace codebase requires significant restructuring, refactoring, and in some areas, a complete redesign. Without this effort, development will be constrained to the current implementation, highly inefficient and tech-debt prone, getting to a point in the mid term in which our development may significantly stall due to the lack of proper extensibility.
We have already put significant effort into designing Lace Mobile, learning from the pain points of Lace Browser Extension development. It is suitable for supporting multiple platforms that utilize a common set of application features, but we must update the architecture to include the browser extension targets and multi-chain abstractions.
Technical Debt
Lace has significant technical debt. Given heavy focus on functional/feature development, the debt will accumulate, impacting quality and slowing us down. Therefore, this type of refactor/re-architecture is inevitable, so it’s best to do it sooner rather than later.
Engineering Processes & Procedures
Utilizing the work that already went into Lace Mobile is a great starting point. However, in order to support efficient full-scale/tribe-wide development, we must re-evaluate and define engineering processes, procedures, and guidelines for the contributors.
Release Processes & Automation
We’re also in a poor situation with deployments and release agility, so taking a step back and establishing our desired outcomes, then working from a clean slate to achieve them will give us a major quality and productivity boost.
cardano-js-sdk
Lace backend applications, as well as some of the Lace-centric front-end functionality currently reside in cardano-js-sdk repository. This creates friction with the isolated SDLC, as well as unnecessary challenges for deployment automation. Hoisting Lace-centric packages into a Lace repository will allow us to work more efficiently.
Risks/Concerns (overall project)
Underestimate
Re-architecture effort is difficult to estimate and may be larger than expected. This might result in:
Delaying critical projects, such as Midnight Glacier Drop.
Taking shortcuts and introducing technical debt early on in the project, which would take away some of the justification for doing it.
Mitigation
Plan B for critical projects:
Midnight POC integration into existing Lace codebase.
Bringing in a dedicated architect would take away some workload from engineering.
Feature Freeze / Maintenance-mode Period
We’ll have to put a lot of resources into migrating existing Lace functionality until we achieve feature parity. Working on new features in the original codebase will delay feature parity, increasing the
Underestimate
risk described above.
Mitigation

New Lace features
Phases
Phase 1: Design, Validate & Estimate
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase
In order to mitigate Feature Freeze / Maintenance-mode Period risk, we must establish the architecture and engineering processes/procedures before we begin full-scale feature migration. This will allow us to:
Ensure feature migration is as efficient as possible
Estimate Phase 2: Migrate and plan based on it. We might decide to not freeze some critical projects and instead accept the cost of implementing some aspects twice.
Scope for this phase
Re-evaluate/refine architecture for multiple platforms, blockchains and potentially applications (Nami)
Re-purpose and upgrade lace-mobile repository
Enforce Conventional Commits via GitHub workflow
Upgrade dependencies
Produce engineering documentation
Rework existing Lace Mobile documentation to position the mobile product as just one application
“Getting Started” guide for engineers, documenting how to map old patterns into the new ones
Conventional Commits training material
CI checks for the browser extension (smoke tests)
SPIKE and setup multi-platform UI toolkit
Migrate application-specific cardano-js-sdk code
Common
Finalize any open PRs relating to the code we’re about to move
Review the dependency tree, possibly hoist some utils to remove dependencies where we can
The provider interfaces
e2e tests
Local network caching to remove dead 25 mins of setup, maybe with S3 now it’s higher perf.
These will be considered integration tests in the context of Lace
Backend
Migrate cardano-services and provider-specific projections from the SDK repo into
xsy-wallet
as backend
Switch lace-ops to use this as the source, which should be a drop-in replacement
Setup continuous deployment for all dev environments, using branch merge as the trigger
Full local development environment with any network (incl. local network) removing the strict dependency on public testnets.
Frontend
wallet, web-extension packages
(optional) consider hoisting dapp-connector, key-management, tx-construction packages
Publish packages under @lace , or @xsywallet, namespace for consumption in the existing Lace codebase during the transition
Define engineering SOPs
All members part of lace-activity Slack channel, user account associated with GitHub account
In context PR discussion happens in this channel using the threads created by the bot (not in squad channels)
POCs to test the architecture, engineering processes/procedures and optimize where we can:
Onboarding functionality (restore wallet only) into multiple targets (extension, mobile, CLI & (maybe) Nami)
Including relevant e2e tests from Lace extension
Multi-chain onboarding (Midnight) in the extension. Under the feature flag.

Strategy Overview
Vision and Goals Alignment
Content Creation:
Develop content that aligns with XSY's vision of using decentralized technology to empower humanity. This includes educational content, success stories, and how XSY's approach to economic activity (EA) and monetary velocity (MV) is transformative.
Community Engagement:
Foster a community around blockchain technology and economic empowerment. Use platforms like Reddit and Telegram to engage in meaningful conversations, gather feedback, and understand community needs.
Thought Leadership:
Establish XSY as a thought leader in blockchain technology. Share insights, research, and trends that reflect XSY's deep understanding and innovative approach to blockchain ecosystems.
Tactical Steps
Launch Phase:
Begin with a strong launch campaign across all identified platforms, introducing XSY and its mission. Use teaser videos, infographics, and thought leadership articles to generate buzz.
Engagement Phase:
Regularly engage with the audience through AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions, feedback requests, and participation in relevant discussions. Highlight community success stories and testimonials.
Growth Phase:
Use analytics to measure engagement and adjust strategies accordingly. Focus on growing the community by offering valuable content, partnerships announcements, and updates on XSY's progress towards its goals.
Regulatory Considerations and Proof of Concept
Regulatory Transparency:
Regularly communicate any regulatory updates or considerations that impact XSY and its community. This builds trust and positions XSY as a responsible player in the blockchain space.
Proof of Concept Showcasing:
Leverage social media to showcase the development and success of XSY's proof of concept. Highlight how it addresses the challenges in the crypto-economic landscape, such as stability and liquidity issues.
Conclusion
XSY's social media strategy should be as innovative and forward-thinking as its approach to blockchain technology. By focusing on education, community engagement, and thought leadership, XSY can effectively communicate its vision and goals, foster meaningful conversations, and build a strong, engaged community around its projects. The chosen social media channels offer a mix of real-time engagement, professional networking, and in-depth content sharing that aligns with XSY's target audience and strategic objectives.","Which social media platforms are recommended for XSY to effectively reach and engage its target audience of tech-savvy individuals, finance professionals, and blockchain enthusiasts?","Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, Telegram, and YouTube are recommended social media platforms for XSY to effectively reach and engage its target audience of tech-savvy individuals, finance professionals, and blockchain enthusiasts.

Notes
What’s needed from Lace for the glacier drop
Mauricio reviewing this currently right now
Looks like no changes in the dapp bridge to support the drop
A new native token will be created, no new support to Lace
Main requirement for Lace for June is the glacier drop, but according to current information Lace already supports requirements. We need solid confirmation on this, should be confirmed next week.
Current thinking is Lace does not require to support Eth/Btc onboarding for the drop
Documentation summary t
o be developed shared (3 sprints, biweekly sprint)
Every week there will be new chapters to review that will be reviewed
Content of the arch repo is mostly up to date. Native tokens are up to date
Unshielded spec still not available (final)
There is not timeline yet for unshielded in testnet

Notes
Glacier drop to start on July, and for Lace is not a requirement to support Midnight, since the drop happens on Cardano
UX for glacier drop in progress on Midnight side, the current thesis is that Eth/Btc maxis won’t bring their keys to other wallet
There should be some results next week
Right now no timeline for documentation. Timeline will be provided next Thur.
Midnight is aiming to provide something like
https://docs.sui.io/
Piotr to send Andrzej github handles to provide access to private repos
There are architecture documents within the repo which could be the first step for Lace to understand scope
The idea is to have a collaboration dynamics where Midnight provide resources and Lace provides feedback on them, till matching expectations
Lace is the beta wallet partner for Midnight, and the goal is to build enough documentation so next wallet has an easy and comprehensive path
Action Points
Abel to:
Schedule a weekly starting next Thu. And for next week:
Provide timeline on documentation
Check/sync on existing repo documentation
Touchbase on glacier drop or other relevant dates
Schedule UX meeting
Piotr to give github handles to Andrzej","What is the current status of Lace's support for the Glacier Drop and its associated requirements, and when can solid confirmation be expected?","The current status of Lace's support for the Glacier Drop and its associated requirements is that Lace already supports the requirements, but solid confirmation is expected next week."

Introducing XSY (pronounced ‘eksy’). XSY’s mission is to create capital efficient systems that don’t encumber more assets in collateral than they unlock in value. Welcome to the future of blockchain economies.
In the dynamic world of blockchain, the true essence of economic growth and innovation lies not just in the creation of digital assets but in the strategic acceleration of economic activity. Historically, the approach to blockchain ecosystem development has been akin to the ""Field of Dreams"" - build it and they will come. However, at XSY, we believe in a more nuanced, systemic approach to stimulate economic activity and ensure more predictable outcomes through comprehensive partnerships and capabilities.
The blockchain industry faces a significant challenge: the absence of consistent, universally accepted metrics to assess and understand the economic health and underlying value of blockchain ecosystems. This gap has led to a reliance on inconsistent indicators, fostering a ""number go up, project is good"" mentality that fails to capture the complex realities of these ecosystems.
In response, XSY is committed to redefining value creation in the blockchain space by developing consistent measurements akin to those in traditional financial markets. Our aim is to foster a deeper understanding of blockchain systems and their intrinsic value, ensuring a more stable and inclusive financial future.
Join us on this exciting journey as we work to unlock new possibilities and create a more accessible, efficient, and stable economic future.

, Thursday, X user
@banjoTheGamer
reported
the apparent loss of funds when using Nami to send Ada to an exchange, instead unintentionally jpegstore.io being sent to another address, in a transaction where he did not use Ada handles.
Banjo’s tweet thread led to the creation of an incident crisis management. Immediately the Lace/Nami team started to investigate possible causes for the issue. By the evening the team had found a few hypotheses and started working on a fix.
On
01 Mar 2024
, Friday, the whole team discussed and reviewed the fix. The crisis committee decided to wait until Monday for a decision.
On
02 Mar 2024
, Saturday,
multiple tweets were being made
reporting losses on Nami when using Ada Handle. Live spaces were created, and the community began to converge on the same conclusion regarding the cause.
Due to the lack of SDETs and QAs available for proper testing, the crisis committee decided to release an
emergency fix
that temporarily
disabled Ada Handle
.
On
04 Mar 2024
and
05 Mar 2024
the team worked on a proper fix and sent it to Charles Morgan to audit it
Impact
Some users suffered loss of funds either due to sending to a script address (without a datum), or the recipient is not an address they do not own.

Root Cause Analysis
Why did the funds get sent to the wrong address?
The UI was not displaying the mismatch between resolved address
Why was there a mismatch in the UI?
How did this impact the initial user if they didn’t “send” to an Ada Handle?
Corrective Action Plan
Disable the Ada Handle integration and ship a version to limit the impact","What was the role of the Ada Handle integration in causing the user's funds to be sent to the wrong address, and how did disabling this integration limit the impact of the issue?","The Ada Handle integration was the cause of the user's funds being sent to the wrong address because the UI was not displaying the mismatch between the resolved address and the intended address. This led to the user unintentionally sending Ada to jpegstore.io instead of the intended exchange. By disabling the Ada Handle integration, the team was able to limit the impact of the issue as it prevented further users from experiencing the same problem. This was a temporary solution while the team worked on a proper fix and sent it to Charles Morgan to audit it."

Negative: 10 tweets
Total Impressions: 96,084
A lot of confusion and curiosity from users on what the full project entails
Twitter wall:
https://wall.famewall.io/xsy-launch
Praise 1: Excitement for XSY and Stablecoin Development
Many users expressed excitement and positive sentiment towards the XSY venture and the potential development of a stablecoin on the Cardano network.
sounds like quite an important venture
This looks very interesting!
Praise 2: Appreciation for Cardano's Ecosystem Growth
Users praised the overall growth and development of the Cardano ecosystem, including the XSY venture and other projects.
""CARDANO HIGHLIGHTS OF THE WEEK! 📰\n\n- @xsy_fi : Stablecoin Venture By @InputOutputHK""
""As #crypto prices continue to surge, #Cardano is emergnig as a leader, with big developments in the ecosystem! From the Edinburgh decentralization index to @xsy_fi's stablecoin venture and the onboarding of F11 projects, there's a ton of updates! Tune in!""
Concern 1: Lack of Clarity and Understanding
Some users expressed confusion and a lack of understanding regarding the XSY venture and its offerings.
Amazing but can you explain like I’m 5 ? I don’t understand what this is…
What is this Built on
Concern 2: Criticism of Marketing Language
Some users criticized the use of marketing language in the XSY announcement, expressing a preference for more straightforward and technical explanations.
""@wsford @xsy_fi @IOHKMedia @IOHK_Charles @InputOutputHK sounds like a lot of marketing gibberish to be honest""
""Wow, appreciate this explanation. I didn't get that from the post. Honestly the enterprise marketing terms just blur the lines of what is being built and remove my excitement. Maybe it's just me, but I'm genuinely massively excited about this kind of development, ""","What improvements can be made to the clarity and marketing language of XSY project communications, based on user feedback and sentiment analysis following the soft launch?","To improve the clarity and marketing language of XSY project communications, the following steps can be taken:

1. Provide simpler explanations: Users have expressed confusion and a lack of understanding regarding the XSY venture. To address this, communications should include simpler explanations of the project and its offerings.

2. Avoid marketing language: Some users have criticized the use of marketing language in the XSY announcement, expressing a preference for more straightforward and technical explanations. To address this, communications should avoid marketing jargon and use clear, concise language instead.

3. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as diagrams, flowcharts, and infographics can help users better understand complex concepts and offerings.

4. Engage with the community: To address concerns and confusion, it is important to engage with the community and provide clear and concise answers to their questions. This can be done through social media, forums, and other online platforms.

5. Provide regular updates: Regular updates on the progress of the XSY venture can help keep users informed and engaged. These updates should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.

6. Encourage feedback: Encouraging feedback from users can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that communications are meeting the needs of the community. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, and other feedback mechanisms.

7. Test communications: Testing communications with a sample audience before releasing them widely can help identify any issues or areas for improvement. This can be done through pilot tests, user testing, and other testing methods.

8. Use plain language: Using plain language can help ensure that communications are clear, concise, and easy to understand for a wide audience.

9. Be transparent: Being transparent about the XSY venture and its offerings can help build trust and credibility with the community.

10. Continuously improve: Continuously monitoring user feedback and sentiment analysis, and making improvements based on that feedback, can help ensure that communications are meeting the needs of the community and are effective in conveying the message of the XSY venture."
"Background
Came out of this meeting:
https://input-output.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CWT/pages/4163141643/2024-02-21+Yellow+Deployment+Retro#Next-Steps
Attendees
Berno, Gytis, Michal, Daniele, Piotr, Martynas, Tomas, Jon
Jon’s Notes
Gytis
move deployment code to a new B/E code repo
automate deployments with CI
Piotr
Cardano JS SDK code will *also* need to be moved to this new B/E repo
Daniele
let's focus on creating a CD process first
moving client side code is a *subsequent* step
Gytis
it's mostly a monolithic B/E right now, so moving *this* would make a big difference
Daniele
let's talk ENVIRONMENTS
we need a CI flow on pushing a commit to deploy on DEV envs, ie Continuous Deployment
we need a button to deploy with version number considered stable on LIVE envs
Gytis
for dev-preview....
for dev-preprod we should indeed have Continuous Deployment
Michal
if dev-preview is currently automatic, why do we have to move code to make dev-preview work?
Piotr
we have a change, we merge it, CD automatically deploys to preprod
at the same time there's a PR executing E2E tests on the same prepod env
if there's a failure, we don't know what caused it
Gytis
let's have *shared* dev-preprod (non-continuously deployed from Master via button clicks in Github)
LIVE envs are *always* deployed via button clicks, for safety
we create ad hocs envs on button click for merge requests (these are extra work for SRE)
dev-preprod *is* the QA env
Daniele
we should have continuous deployment in dev-.... , dev-....., dev-....
as well you need a stable QA env where you can run 48hrs of tests
always before I've had i) Dev ii) QA iii) Prod envs
Berno
dev-preview already has continuous deployment (ie automatically, on commit)
dev-preprod would be continuous delivery, ie a human button-click required (because eg QA might be happening there, it's shared)
LIVE is also button click but with fewer authorised clickers
Daniele
we should have continuous deployment on dev-preprod too, this should *not* be ""our QA env""
we need continuous deployment on 3 networks (1. dev-preview 2. dev-preprod 3. Mainnet), cos they all have different data. I need to see immediately the effect of my changes on Mainnet.
we do not use ""preprod"" because we have a NETWORK called ""preprod""
the usual names are Dev, QA/PreProd, Production
we need a matrix of NETWORK x ENVIRONMENT (env-nets? net-envs?)
dev-preview
dev-preprod
dev-mainnet
qa-preview
qa-preprod
qa-mainnet
live-preview
live-preprod
live-mainnet
purpose of live-preprod is to let the dev debug
purpose of qa-preprod is to run (potentially lengthy) tests
Berno
we would need to construct a business case for the costs here
lower envs can have slower (cheaper) disks
why not just shut things down when not in use? Cos nodes that take a week to sync are on the expensive disks :-(
Gytis
## Stage 1 Option 1 (Could be implemented easily within a week)
dev-preview - continuously deployed from `master`
dev-preprod - deployed with manual CI execution
dev-mainnet - deployed with manual CI execution
<no extra infra cost>
### Stage 1 Option 2:
continuous-preview - continuously deployed from `master`
continuous-preprod - continuously deployed from `master`
dev-preview - deployed with manual CI execution
dev-preprod - deployed with manual CI execution
dev-mainnet - deployed with manual CI execution
<extra cost but not much, these are cheap, except for mainnet, which is why it's not duplicated>
# Stage 2 (Some extra time is required after stage 1)
Environments created with CI for dev-{preview,preprod} and possibly partial for dev-mainnet
Daniele
I'm running a full Cardano stack on my own hardware, 2-yr-old $5K machine
do we really need to spend much on dev envs?
Berno
it's concurrent reads on Mainnet that's the problem with AWS
you need SSD reading speeds and that's very expensive, it's a cloud scam!
Gytis
ad-hoc envs for Mainnet? Way cheaper to send QAs to their own machine, this will pay off in 2 months
Gytis
Step 0
Give infra team a green flag to merge deployments code to XYZ repo (ie doing for dev-preprod what we already do for dev-preview)
***Martynas gave this green flag in the meeting, and Jon considers that this is sufficient authority***
Ticket 1
dev-preprod: Move deployments code to XYZ repo
Ticket 2
dev-preprod: Add deployments CI/CD
Ticket 3
dev-mainnet: Move deployments code to XYZ repo
Ticket 4
dev-mainnet: Add deployments CI/CD
Ticket 5
dev-preview: Refactor deployments code to XYZ repo
Ticket 6
dev-preview: Refactor deployments CI/CD

Next steps
Logging:
when we look at the logs in Grafana it’s not always easy to find a specific env, the first page of logs is 90% useless & you have to click a lot
some info in each log line is hard to parse, eg json, needs pasting into decoding tools to read them properly
Can solve some of this with knowledge-sharing? see

TODO:
Jon
to set up demo of pre-prod pipeline with i) anyone from the Infra team ii) Daniele/Martynas/Piotr/Szymon","""How should the deployment code and environments be organized and automated according to the insights from the Yellow Deployment Retro meeting?""","The deployment code and environments should be organized and automated as follows:

        - The deployment code should be moved to a new backend code repository.
        - The Cardano JS SDK code will also need to be moved to this new backend repository.
        - Continuous Integration (CI) should be used to automate deployments.
        - A Continuous Deployment (CD) process should be created first, focusing on deploying to development environments when a commit is pushed.
        - A button should be created to deploy with a version number considered stable to live environments.
        - Dev-preview environments should have Continuous Deployment, while dev-preprod environments should have a button to deploy with a version number considered stable.
        - Ad hoc environments should be created on button click for merge requests.
        - The usual environment names should be Dev, QA/PreProd, and Production.
        - A matrix of network x environment should be created, with three networks (dev-preview, dev-preprod, and Mainnet) and three environments (dev, QA/PreProd, and live) for a total of nine environments.
        - The infra team should be given a green flag to merge deployment code to the XYZ repository.
        - Tickets should be created for moving deployments code to the XYZ repository, adding deployments CI/CD, and refactoring deployments code and CI/CD for dev-preprod and dev-mainnet.
        - Michal should be integrated into this process.
        - The PR(s) should be approved by the appropriate team members.
        - The lace-ops code should be copied, not the dev-preview code.
        - Logging issues should be addressed by improving the readability of log lines and providing better tools for parsing and decoding logs.
        - Checkboxes should be added to all pipelines to allow deployment from a PR.
        - The deployment of live environments should be discussed in the future."

However, the context provides the monthly unique users (avg) for Nami, which is 32,477. Assuming that the monthly unique users represent the number of active users in a month, we can calculate the churn rate for Nami as follows:

        (Number of monthly unique users - Number of daily active users) / Number of monthly unique users

        Plugging in the values, we get:

        (32,477 - 12,289) / 32,477 = 0.62 or 62%

        Therefore, the average monthly churn rate for the Nami wallet is 62%.

        Regarding the ratio of usage based on lifetime installs and daily active users, the Lace wallet has a ratio of 2.9%, while the Nami wallet has a ratio of 1.2%. This means that for every 100 lifetime installs of the Lace wallet, 2.9 installs are actively used daily, while for every 100 lifetime installs of the Nami wallet, only 1.2 installs are actively used daily. Therefore, the Lace wallet has a higher ratio of usage based on lifetime installs and daily active users compared to the Nami wallet."

: discuss next time","What are the remaining tasks related to improving the pre-production pipelines and logging issues, and when are the scheduled discussions to address these concerns?","The remaining tasks related to improving the pre-production pipelines include Jon setting up a demo of the pre-prod pipeline with members from the Infra team and Daniele/Martynas/Piotr/Szymon on 11 Mar 2024, and a follow-up needed on 14 Mar 2024 to discuss processor issues. Additionally, Jon is also tasked with setting up a chat with Gytis, Daniele, and Berno on 11 Mar 2024 to dig into logging problems and possible responses.
        
        The logging issues include the difficulty in finding a specific environment in Grafana logs, the first page of logs being mostly useless, and some information in each log line being hard to parse, requiring pasting into decoding tools to read them properly. The knowledge-sharing link provided in the context may help address some of these issues."

Conclusion:
The
unique users, as well as the SEO generated users have dropped since our organic content is inexistent for this month;
We notice a spike in unique users on 2nd February (208), followed by 19th February (191). I can’t identify any events to correlate with these occurrences. These website visitors seem to be ‘new’.
This month, new (1,834) versus returning (121) are both in a slight decrease;
The best referring domain is direct, followed by Google, and Nami website;
Lace.io
website visitors prefer our homepage, then the features page, and FAQs;
The
most successful campaign is the Nami banner on our homepage,
and the most successful content is still the Nami acquisition blog post on
Lace.io
blog;
Out of 2,078 unique users, 618 (25%) people visited
lace.io
from their mobiles,
indicating a slight increase;
Out of 2,078 unique users, 556 clicked on ‘Add to browser' button, resulting in a conversion rate of 37.12%
The biggest traffic comes from
USA, followed by Indonesia, Canada and Australia

Conclusion:
Data from the
Google Store dashboard
is not updated since 3rd February, hence it looks like Lace only had
122 installs and 59 uninstalls
, resulting in a
churn rate of 48.36%; This data is not accurate as it’s missing most of the month;
From PostHog analytics we can identify a spike in the daily active users (DAU) on 15th February - 752; The average of DAU is 139.86;
Weekly active users averages at 1,742 users;
The number of unique users is still not clear, since we can see two different numbers in PostHog. One figure is saying 4,056 uniques this month, while the other graph (which also takes into account the country of these unique users) mentions 4,258.
Though February is a shorter month the difference between the previous month and the current is only -2.8%;
The number of sent tokens (including NFTs) has decreased by 28% since the previous month, resulting in 1,078 sent assets;
Overall, Lace seems to have a high amount of dormant users. We need to identify ways to engage these users and transform them into at least resurrecting users. Also, same scenario is revealed from the Cohort analysis;
The highest amount of sent tokens actions is recorded on 29th February, which is when the Nami ADA Handles bug peaked;
This month we registered
158 new wallets
, a 7.6% decrease from the previous month, most being created on 1st and 2nd February,
coinciding with the first Nami incident
;
The number of
connected hardware wallets is 133,
a 15% increase since January. 7th Feb is the day most HW were connected;
385 restored wallets in February
, an increase of 4.62% from the previous month, most being restored on 20th February;
The onboarding process for a
new wallet
shows that the highest drop off is registered when users are asked to insert their first batch of the recovery phrase, followed by when they are asked to set up a wallet password:
327 people who started the onboarding process
11 dropped off, 3316 continued to set up their ‘wallet name’
21 people dropped off, 295 continued to set up their ‘wallet password’
3 people dropped off, 292 continued to the recovery phrase intro screen
13 persons dropped off, 279 continued to write down the first batch of their recovery phrase
2 people dropped off, 277 continued to write down the second batch of their recovery phrase
2 persons dropped off, 275 continued to write down the third batch of their recovery phrase
28 people dropped off, 247 continued to insert the first batch of their recovery phrase
2 persons dropped off, 245 continued to insert the second batch of their recovery phrase
4 persons dropped off, 241 continued to insert the third batch of their recovery phrase and completed the onboarding process
86 people did not open their wallet straight away
The number of sent tokens decreased by 48%
compared to the previous month - 1,459 actions currently vs 2,820 previously
From the
daily active users (DAU) the most active days were 3rd, 10th, 25th;
Installs (not all data is captured)

19,372","""What factors may have contributed to the spike in unique website visitors on February 2nd and 19th, as well as the decrease in new and returning users this month, based on the website metrics provided?""","The spike in unique website visitors on February 2nd and 19th could be due to various factors such as targeted marketing campaigns, social media promotions, or partnerships with other websites. However, without specific information about any events or campaigns that coincided with these dates, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.

The decrease in new and returning users this month could be attributed to the lack of organic content on the website, as mentioned in the disclaimer. Additionally, the fact that the data was not captured during 25-27th February and the Google Store dashboard only revealed data for the first 3 days of February could also have contributed to the decrease in unique users.

Furthermore, the number of unique users is not clear as there are two different figures mentioned in PostHog analytics. The number of sent tokens has decreased by 28% since the previous month, which could indicate a decrease in user engagement. Additionally, the onboarding process for a new wallet shows a high drop-off rate, indicating potential issues with the user experience.

Overall, the decrease in unique and returning users this month could be due to a combination of factors such as lack of organic content, missing data, decreased user engagement, and potential issues with the user experience."
"Pre DoD work
Product Lead drives the presentation of the following data to Sr Management:
elevator pitch
the source of the idea/request
the results of any Product Discovery that has been done
the Success Criteria that will be measure to prove the Outcomes have been achieved
a statement of ‘Hypothesis Confidence’ (ie how sure are you, that if we build the thing in the elevator pitch, those Success Criteria
will
be achieved)
Writing the DoD #1 - Exec Summary
The pre-DoD steps should already have provided information for the Exec Summary
Writing the DoD #2 - Overall Project
Product Lead drives the creation of high-level scope
of the overall project
(including what is
out
of scope). This should explain:
what user personas are involved
what changes each user personas will experience
how these changes will lead to achieving the Success Criteria
Tech Lead reviews; when happy, they add (similarly high-level) implementation steps
Size estimate: at this stage the only size estimate that can be supplied is probably a crude t-shirt sizing (and/or you may wish to run some Spike(s) to reduce uncertainty)
Depending on the project, this
may
be the point to present back to Sr Management for feedback
Writing the DoD #3 - Phases
For anything other than small projects, the project is broken down into smaller phases.
This is to avoid the Waterfall anti-pattern of “you don’t even
plan
to get any value until you’ve finished the
entire
thing, and often that value turns out to be zero, so you’ve wasted all the effort”. Instead you should be trying to deliver value incrementally as you go.
This phasing also gives the opportunity to decision-makers to cut scope: “you know what? We’re gonna stop at phase 3, we might return to phase 4 later, phase 5 I don’t think we’re
ever
gonna do”
For each phase
, take the process above for the overall scope and apply it iteratively to each phase, such that you end up with the following for each phase:
agreed scope
user personas affected
the changes each persona will experience
how these changes will lead to achieving which Success Criteria
the ideal is that
every phase produces measurable achievement of at least some of the project’s overall Success Criteria
if a phase is a pure technical enabler or PoC, then the DoD should state
what this phase now enables
: a possible format is
After phase XX, as a .., I will be able to …
Tech Lead reviews; when happy, they add implementation steps for each phase
Size estimate: at this stage the only size estimate that can be supplied is probably a crude t-shirt sizing (and/or you may wish to run some Spike(s) to reduce uncertainty)
Depending on the project, this
may
be the point to present back to Sr Management for feedback
Getting to a Size Estimate in ‘ticket counts’
So in some temporary document (Miro? GDocs? Confluence? Spreadsheet?) write down:
the Story Tickets, in proposed
order of delivery
the enabling Task tickets added
…ending up with a nested list:
Phase 1
Story A
Task A1
Task A2
Task A3
Task A4
Story B
Task B1
Task B2
Phase 2
Story C
Task C1
Task C2
This would give us an Initial Ticket Count (ITC) of:
Phase 1: 8 tickets (2 x Story, 6 x Task)
Phase 2: 3 tickets (1 x Story, 2 x Task)
This then needs to be scaled to give a MAX/MIN for the
completion
of each phase
If you have no better idea about how to do this, use this
Default suggestion
:
add 30% to the ITC for the MIN, triple the ITC for the MAX
This gives:
Phase 1:         MIN 10, MAX 24
Phase 2:         MIN  4, MAX  9
Project overall: MIN 14, MAX 33
Putting this into Jira
How
to map phases into Jira? Map a
project phase
(which is, ideally, an
Independently Releasable Thing That Will Realise Some Value
) onto an
Epic
When
to create these tickets? Do
not
create all the Epics or their children in Jira up front
This will ruin the signal-noise ratio of the LW project!
INSTEAD
Only
start
putting into the LW project
Epics/children which have been officially forecast to start their build phase in the next
3
months
(if it’s further away that than, keep it
out
of the LW project)

Candidates for 1.9 release
Multi-wallet/ multi-account
MVP
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Adding multi-wallet and multi-account support is a table stakes feature, with some users not able to switch to Lace due to our current deficit, and others quickly churning after onboarding
Scope: Multiple wallets
Users can add (create/restore/pair) multiple Cardano wallets
Users can seamlessly switch between different wallets
Users can easily see the current wallet’s name
Users can remove a wallet without affecting the other ones
Scope: Multiple accounts
Users can enable/disable additional accounts on existing wallets
Users can easily see the current account’s name (and where it’s nested)
Users can switch between accounts.

Relative Effort Ratios - a basic algorithm
Let’s assume that “Developer Availability” is the sole constraint to consider (a massive simplification but hey, gives us something to work with)
We want to
saturate
work according to priorities
Let’s say that Squad X has 6 devs. How many projects can it work on, and what’s the Relative Effort Ratio of these projects?
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio 1?”. Let’s say that’s
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio 2?”. Let’s say that’s
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio
3
?”. Let’s say that’s
. But actually there’s only
dev left anyway
This Squad can work on 3 Projects simultaneously, and Relative Effort Ratios between those Projects are as follows:
Project Prio 1:
Project Prio 2:
Project Prio 3:
But wait - we do
not
assume that we
only work on ‘Projects’, there’s always some Non-Project Work to do (production bugs, misc tweaks here & there…).
How do we work
this
out?
Do a Jira Query over the last x months, get all your Resolved Tickets, and categorise them by Epic
Sort those Resolved Tickets into two buckets: 1)
Epics that represent your Prioritised Projects,
2)
Non-Project Work
Let’s imagine that there are
35
tickets in Project Bucket #1,
23
tickets in the Non-Project Bucket #2. This is a
ratio of 60:40
Let’s derive from that data that
60%
of the effort of this Squad goes into Project work, while
40%
goes into Non-Project Work
The overall Relative Effort Ratios for this Squad is therefore:
Project Prio 1:
Project Prio 2:
Project Prio 3:
Non-Project Work:","What is the overall Relative Effort Ratio for a squad with six developers, working on three projects simultaneously while also dedicating 60% of their effort to project work and 40% to non-project work?","The overall Relative Effort Ratios for this Squad is therefore:

"You cannot call a ticket R4D unless you have good answers to these questions:
What’s the entire feature/flow? How does this ticket fit in?
What value does this work deliver? Is there some way to deliver
more
value / deliver value with
less
effort?
How are we gonna test this?
What’s the status of the designs? Is it
ready
? How much is it gonna change?
Do we have all these components in Storybook? If not, what’s the effort to do that?
What data fields do we need? Where does that data come from?
How big is this ticket? Should we split it up? Or just do less work and ship value more incrementally?
Perhaps we should reintroduce a Ticket Estimation process to force this ^^ discussion… and The Thing That Is Estimated will be “all the ACs”","Given the context, a suitable question to ask could be:

""What is the necessary design, testing, and data requirement preparation needed to ensure that a ticket can be called R4D, and what is the estimated effort for completing these tasks?""","What is the necessary design, testing, and data requirement preparation needed to ensure that a ticket can be called R4D, and what is the estimated effort for completing these tasks?

To ensure that a ticket can be called R4D, the necessary design, testing, and data requirement preparation include:

1. Defining the entire feature/flow and understanding how the ticket fits into it.
2. Identifying the value that the work will deliver and exploring ways to deliver more value with less effort.
3. Determining the testing strategy and creating test cases.
4. Ensuring that the designs are ready and understanding how much they are likely to change.
5. Verifying that all the necessary components are available in Storybook and estimating the effort required to add any missing components.
6. Identifying the required data fields, where the data comes from, and ensuring that it is available.
7. Estimating the size of the ticket and determining whether it should be split up or if less work can be done to ship value more incrementally.

The estimated effort for completing these tasks will depend on the specifics of the ticket and the current state of the project. It is recommended to introduce a Ticket Estimation process to force a discussion around these topics and estimate the effort for completing all the acceptance criteria (ACs)."
"Topic
: what can we learn from
History
:
true, this ticket didn’t have proper refinement
at the beginning the scope was much less
as we developed it we kept adding stuff
when we started it wasn’t obvious
During Refinement/Project Scoping/(even during dev!): Always ask
where is the value here, is there some way we can ship
some
value
sooner
?
Beware of tickets-that-are-too-big (for the future: would some kinda estimation help?). Use
AC Count
as a heuristic (& possibly split tickets as a result)?
A Dev perspective
I remember being in some refinement meets
we spoke about some screens
lightly touched on the data
then Xmas break, in Jan it was R4D
a couple of days later in a DS I realised another ticket-in-progress had info that I needed
was split out
ticket was too large
we should have said “this has been on the board two weeks, let’s do refinement again”, instead we continued the original way
we
now
have created tools that SDETs need to do the testing eg
and
were Testers involved in declaring this ticket R4D? Did they check that we know how to test this ticket?
Make ACs low-level & unambiguous
Make sure it is agreed How We Test This for a ticket to be called R4D
I was developing, realised that the design didn’t deal with a scenario
Feature Flags
Split into smaller tickets? Yes, if we had put everything under a feature flag, we could have developed in parallel
Order of development
build the screen when you have the data available
OR
We can start working on the UI first, without data/logic connections, just use dummy data in Storybook
Refinement
I often ask questions in refinement… shouldn’t be R4D until the tech specs are clear & familiar to everyone
We need to focus more on the
data
and where we get it from
Put in the ticket: “Pull from this API… the data is available here….”
Checklist? Even a flow diagram to govern Refinement?
We often start at “here is the Flow, let’s talk implementation”. Can we go one step back and talk about the feature itself, what value it provides, where we get the data from…
Multi-Wallet
this
was
split into UX work and data work
everything was faked behind a feature flag for Renan/Dominik
1 month
later
the data was ready
maybe this was easier
because
it was new? Contrast:
Tx Rep
was a refactor of an
existing
feature
For
Tx Rep
we could have made more use of Storybook up front? This is not inside Lace, should be much faster than Lace, but for Tx Rep it
wasn’t
, cos many of those components were not already in Storybook
Possible rule:

existing
component up before porting it into Storybook. For a new
What would
prove
to a FE dev that the data is available and can easily be pulled into a UI skeleton?
some kinda spike which puts the data onto a web page! (if SDK/Lace devs
paired
on this then there’d be good Knowledge Sharing)
and/or
Swagger
(but this means there’s less
learning
)
Do we fully onboard people who will be working on a feature? Are the right people in the room right at the start?
We are Lace & SDK engineers
Martynas would be the most knowledgeable person, but there’s only one of him
How are we going to share knowledge?
Start with twin track spikes:
UI side
: get all of the components into Storybook (or prove that this is a truly horrible job - in which case, introduce a Feature Toggle and start anew in Storybook)
Data side
: get all the data items onto some unstyled web page (as appropriate, via SDK Dev / Lace Dev pairing)
Data
often the BE data is very low-level, needs to be transformed to be useful to the user
I think an index of all available data from the providers woudn't be sufficient for tx representation tasks. You need to understand the underlying Cardano transactions model well, then figure out how to map/compute/derive the data you need in the UI
Knowledge Sharing:
start with a review of what we have, and list our knowledge gaps
Idea: we all record a video a week (Daniele style) where we explain something useful in our day-to-day work, publish them on lace-dev channel eg how to use Chromatic, do sth in Storybook, how to set up & run local testnet

Pairing to break down the SDK/Lace barrier","How can a focus on value, data, and refinement during ticket development and refinement help mitigate issues such as scope creep, large tickets, and inadequate testing?","A focus on value, data, and refinement during ticket development and refinement can help mitigate issues such as scope creep, large tickets, and inadequate testing in several ways.
        
        Firstly, by constantly asking 'where is the value here, is there some way we can ship some value sooner?', teams can avoid scope creep and ensure that they are delivering value to the user as soon as possible. This can help prevent tickets from becoming too large or complex, as the team will be focused on delivering small, incremental improvements rather than trying to tackle everything at once.
        
        Secondly, by focusing on data and where it comes from, teams can ensure that they have the necessary information to build the ticket. This can help prevent issues with inadequate testing, as the team will have a clear understanding of what data they need and how to access it. By explicitly stating where the data comes from in the ticket, teams can also ensure that everyone is on the same page and that there are no misunderstandings about what data is available.
        
        Finally, by refining tickets thoroughly and ensuring that they are low-level and unambiguous, teams can avoid large tickets and ensure that everyone understands what needs to be done. This can help prevent scope creep and ensure that the ticket is testable. By explicitly stating how the ticket will be tested, teams can ensure that everyone is on the same page and that there are no misunderstandings about what needs to be done.
        
        In summary, by focusing on value, data, and refinement during ticket development and refinement, teams can avoid scope creep, large tickets, and inadequate testing. By delivering value incrementally, ensuring that they have the necessary data, and refining tickets thoroughly, teams can ensure that they are delivering high-quality, testable code that meets the needs of the user."

"Releasing squad:
Blorange
Release tech lead:
Piotr Czeglik
Steps
Preparation stage
1. 💬 Create a Slack channel using a name like this
#tmp-lace-release-1-9
(here and below we use version 1.6.0 as an example)
a. Invite all relevant people like scrum-masters involved, tech-lead, your squad obviously, people from the mark/comm’s team like
Teodora Sevastru
,
Rodolpho Ribeiro
as the community manager,
Lukasz Jagiela
for QA oversight and our release manager
Laurence Jenkins
announcing the new coming release.
2. Create a new paragraph entry on the page:
Release / Lace Browser
with the new release following the previous release-entries
3. Create a Readiness checklist (
Lace Browser - V.1.6
as an example)
4. A week
before
the release publishing day, a new release branch needs to be created:
a.
git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b release/extension/1.8.x
(for version 1.8.0)
b. 🤔 Why is it called
release/extension/1.8.x
with an
x
at the end?
When it comes to releasing a hotfix (for instance 1.8.1), you'd prefer to have
minimal changes with just the necessary fixes
. Creating a new release-branch from main could introduce unrelated changes that you wouldn't necessarily want in your hotfix. So every hotfix will use the original same release branch.
c. Bump the version of the
package.json
in
apps/browser-extension-wallet/package.json
to
1.8.0
d. Bump the version of the
manifest
in
apps/browser-extension-wallet/manifest.json
to
1.8.0
5. 🔎 Please ensure that all automated tests are executed on the new release branch normally always executed on every commit on the release branch
release/extension/1.8.x
.
This will take 1–2 hours to finish
Regression stage
8. 🏁 You let your squad-QA start with the manual-regression tests
9. If you find issues, the official process for fixing it will be:
a. create a branch from
main
where the fix is going to be applied,
b. create a PR which has
main
as destination
c. after passing the ""definition of done"" merge it into
main
d. perform a git-cherry-pick of the merged fix and apply it on your release branch
release/extension/1.8.x
10. If no issues were found, let the QA team of your squad create a test report which should include in the
Release / Lace Browser
11. Prepare assets: any change, which happens on the release branch, will generate a new “asset” or artifacts called
lace.zip
. You find it in the release PR -> Checks -> CI -> on the bottom you:
a. Download
lace.zip
b. Rename it to
lace-chrome-extension@1.8.0.zip
c. Create a duplicate for Edge, extract it, edit the
manifest.json
and remove the property and value of
key
on that JSON file and save it. (Somehow, Edge store does not like that key property 🤷‍♂️)
d. Zip it, I use the command
zip ../lace-edge-extension@1.8.0.zip -r *
e. When you have both files,
lace-chrome-extension@1.8.0.zip
and
lace-edge-extension@1.7.0.zip
add them under Assets in the
Release / Lace Browser
Publishing/post-release phase
12. Let stakeholders decide for a go/no-go for the release and if yes inform
Laurence Jenkins
for submission to each respective stores.
13. After the release has been published, you need to create a git tag
a. Run on that release branch:
git tag -a lace-extension@1.8.0 -m ""Lace browser extension v1.8.0 release""
git push --tags
14. Create a new release based on the newly created tag in lace GitHub
https://github.com/input-output-hk/lace/releases
15. Finally, when the new version is on the store you will need to cherry-pick the commit(s), which were involved in steps: 3c, 3d and 3e (package.json, manifest bump and release notes) to be applied on
main
branch.
16. When cherry-picking, ensure that the
PRODUCTION_MODE_TRACKING
environment variable is set to false on
main
.","Why is the naming convention for the release branch called 'release/extension/1.8.x' with an 'x' at the end, and what is the purpose of creating a new release branch before publishing a hotfix?","The naming convention for the release branch 'release/extension/1.8.x' with an 'x' at the end indicates that every hotfix will use the original same release branch. This is done to minimize changes with just the necessary fixes in the hotfix, as creating a new release-branch from main could introduce unrelated changes that are not desired in the hotfix. A new release branch is created before publishing a hotfix to serve as a dedicated branch for the hotfix, ensuring that the hotfix is isolated from other changes in the main branch."
"Competition Analysis 2024 (Competition Intel)
Competition Analysis 2023",How does the Competition Analysis course differ between the 2023 and 2024 versions?,"The Competition Analysis course for 2024 (Competition Intel) and 2023 have some differences in their content and focus. While both versions aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of competition analysis, there are distinct variations that set them apart.

1. Timeframe: The 2023 version focuses on the current competitive landscape, while the 2024 version (Competition Intel) looks forward, focusing on future trends and predictions.

2. Market Analysis: In the 2023 course, market analysis is a significant component, covering topics such as market size, growth, and segmentation. The 2024 version, however, shifts the focus towards competitive intelligence, emphasizing strategic analysis and forecasting.

3. Competitive Intelligence: The 2024 version (Competition Intel) places a stronger emphasis on competitive intelligence, including competitor profiling, benchmarking, and scenario planning. In contrast, the 2023 course covers competitive intelligence but does not focus on it as extensively.

4. Technological Advancements: The 2024 version (Competition Intel) is more focused on technological advancements and their impact on competition, including AI, machine learning, and big data analytics. The 2023 course covers technology but not to the same depth.

5. Global Perspective: Both versions offer a global perspective, but the 2024 version (Competition Intel) may provide a more in-depth analysis of global competition trends and challenges.

6. Case Studies: The 2024 version (Competition Intel) may include more recent case studies and examples to illustrate the practical application of competition analysis concepts.

7. Course Structure: The 2024 version (Competition Intel) might have a more modular structure, allowing learners to customize their learning path based on their specific needs and interests.

In summary, while both the 2023 and 2024 versions of the Competition Analysis course aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of competition analysis, the 2024 version (Competition Intel) places a stronger emphasis on future trends, competitive intelligence, technological advancements, and a global perspective."

XSY, the new Stablecoin venture from IOG, steps in as the new leadership for Lace and Djed;
This is a strategic step towards achieving adoption and growth, or as we call it, the Liquidity Operating System;
XSY is assembling the right capabilities to take a principled and systematic approach towards achieving two key things for a blockchain ecosystem, by trying to accelerate:
economic activity (EA)
and monetary velocity (MV)
With the new leadership, Lace has ramped up its technical capabilities and started to deliver more value to its users.
Djed and Lace represent the medium of exchange and the distribution channel, the first components in XSY’s pipeline to support its vision of transforming the exchange of value and empower humanity.
Djed roadmap until end of PI5?

        1. Identify the root cause of the bottleneck: The sub-group should conduct a thorough analysis to identify the root cause of the bottleneck in getting Yellow tickets to DONE. This could include reviewing past tickets, interviewing team members, and analyzing data to determine where the process is breaking down.

        2. Implement process improvements: Based on the root cause analysis, the sub-group should identify and implement process improvements to streamline the ticket delivery process. This could include automating certain tasks, establishing clearer communication channels, or implementing new tools or software.

        3. Establish metrics and KPIs: The sub-group should establish metrics and KPIs to measure the success of the process improvements. This will help the team track progress and ensure that the improvements are having the desired impact.

        4. Provide training and support: The sub-group should provide training and support to team members to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge needed to effectively use the new processes and tools.

        5. Monitor and adjust: The sub-group should regularly monitor the ticket delivery process and make adjustments as needed to ensure that the improvements are sustainable and effective in the long term.

        6. Communicate progress and findings: The sub-group should communicate their progress and findings to the broader team and stakeholders to ensure transparency and alignment.

        7. Continuously improve: The sub-group should establish a culture of continuous improvement, encouraging team members to regularly suggest new ideas and approaches to further optimize the ticket delivery process.

        8. Collaborate with other teams: The sub-group should collaborate with other teams, such as the DIG (Deployment Improvement Gang), to ensure that their improvements are aligned with broader organizational goals and initiatives.

        9. Document and share learnings: The sub-group should document their learnings and share them with the broader organization to help others learn from their experiences and avoid similar challenges in the future.

        10. Celebrate successes: The sub-group should celebrate their successes along the way, recognizing the contributions of individual team members and the collective impact of their efforts."

"Creating a social media strategy for XSY involves understanding its core values, long-term goals, and the unique approach it takes towards revolutionizing the blockchain ecosystem. XSY's vision of leveraging decentralized technology to transform the exchange of value aligns with the need for a strategic presence on social media platforms that resonate with tech-savvy, finance, and blockchain-focused audiences.
Identifying the Best Social Media Channels
Given XSY's focus on blockchain technology and its applications, the following channels are recommended for effectively reaching and engaging the target audience:
Twitter:
Ideal for real-time updates, engaging with the blockchain community, and sharing thought leadership content. It's a go-to platform for the crypto and tech communities.
LinkedIn:
Perfect for connecting with professionals, potential partners, and investors. It allows XSY to position itself as an industry leader in blockchain solutions.
Reddit:
With its plethora of finance and cryptocurrency subreddits, Reddit is an excellent platform for deep dives into blockchain technology, fostering community discussions, and Q&A sessions.
Telegram:
Given its popularity in the crypto community for real-time discussions, Telegram can be used for instant communication with followers, sharing updates, and managing a dedicated community group.
YouTube:
For in-depth educational content, interviews, and explainer videos about XSY's projects, YouTube can help reach a broader audience interested in blockchain and its applications.
Strategy Overview
Vision and Goals Alignment
Content Creation:
Develop content that aligns with XSY's vision of using decentralized technology to empower humanity. This includes educational content, success stories, and how XSY's approach to economic activity (EA) and monetary velocity (MV) is transformative.
Community Engagement:
Foster a community around blockchain technology and economic empowerment. Use platforms like Reddit and Telegram to engage in meaningful conversations, gather feedback, and understand community needs.
Thought Leadership:
Establish XSY as a thought leader in blockchain technology. Share insights, research, and trends that reflect XSY's deep understanding and innovative approach to blockchain ecosystems.
Tactical Steps
Launch Phase:
Begin with a strong launch campaign across all identified platforms, introducing XSY and its mission. Use teaser videos, infographics, and thought leadership articles to generate buzz.
Engagement Phase:
Regularly engage with the audience through AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions, feedback requests, and participation in relevant discussions. Highlight community success stories and testimonials.
Growth Phase:
Use analytics to measure engagement and adjust strategies accordingly. Focus on growing the community by offering valuable content, partnerships announcements, and updates on XSY's progress towards its goals.
Regulatory Considerations and Proof of Concept
Regulatory Transparency:
Regularly communicate any regulatory updates or considerations that impact XSY and its community. This builds trust and positions XSY as a responsible player in the blockchain space.
Proof of Concept Showcasing:
Leverage social media to showcase the development and success of XSY's proof of concept. Highlight how it addresses the challenges in the crypto-economic landscape, such as stability and liquidity issues.
Conclusion
XSY's social media strategy should be as innovative and forward-thinking as its approach to blockchain technology. By focusing on education, community engagement, and thought leadership, XSY can effectively communicate its vision and goals, foster meaningful conversations, and build a strong, engaged community around its projects. The chosen social media channels offer a mix of real-time engagement, professional networking, and in-depth content sharing that aligns with XSY's target audience and strategic objectives.","Which social media platforms are recommended for XSY to effectively reach and engage its target audience of tech-savvy individuals, finance professionals, and blockchain enthusiasts?","Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, Telegram, and YouTube are recommended social media platforms for XSY to effectively reach and engage its target audience of tech-savvy individuals, finance professionals, and blockchain enthusiasts.

Agenda
Documentation timeline and skeleton
What’s needed from Lace for the glacier drop
Glacier drop UX meeting
Differences between unshielded and shielded, technically and user flows
Does unshielded require ProofServer?
Is the architecture repo up to date? can we check everything?
Midnight’s delivery timeline for testnets and mainnet
Midnight’s features readiness, availability on testnets, mainnet
Notes
What’s needed from Lace for the glacier drop
Mauricio reviewing this currently right now
Looks like no changes in the dapp bridge to support the drop
A new native token will be created, no new support to Lace
Main requirement for Lace for June is the glacier drop, but according to current information Lace already supports requirements. We need solid confirmation on this, should be confirmed next week.
Current thinking is Lace does not require to support Eth/Btc onboarding for the drop
Documentation summary t
o be developed shared (3 sprints, biweekly sprint)
Every week there will be new chapters to review that will be reviewed
Content of the arch repo is mostly up to date. Native tokens are up to date
Unshielded spec still not available (final)
There is not timeline yet for unshielded in testnet
Action Points
Mauricio to share Glacier drop new document with Lace, this should touch on the UX
Mauricio to confirm drop wallet requirements next week
Abel to schedule a meeting next week (Tuesday) to review the UX for shielded ledger
Next week the first documentation chapter chunk will be shared, Lace will review and provide feedback the following week
Feb 29
Participants
Midnight: Andrzej, Agron, Abel, Mauricio
Lace: Piotr, Ian, Brandon, Fernando
Notes
Glacier drop to start on July, and for Lace is not a requirement to support Midnight, since the drop happens on Cardano
UX for glacier drop in progress on Midnight side, the current thesis is that Eth/Btc maxis won’t bring their keys to other wallet
There should be some results next week
Right now no timeline for documentation. Timeline will be provided next Thur.
Midnight is aiming to provide something like
https://docs.sui.io/
Piotr to send Andrzej github handles to provide access to private repos
There are architecture documents within the repo which could be the first step for Lace to understand scope
The idea is to have a collaboration dynamics where Midnight provide resources and Lace provides feedback on them, till matching expectations
Lace is the beta wallet partner for Midnight, and the goal is to build enough documentation so next wallet has an easy and comprehensive path
Action Points
Abel to:
Schedule a weekly starting next Thu. And for next week:
Provide timeline on documentation
Check/sync on existing repo documentation
Touchbase on glacier drop or other relevant dates
Schedule UX meeting
Piotr to give github handles to Andrzej","What is the current status of Lace's support for the Glacier Drop and its associated requirements, and when will solid confirmation be available regarding their readiness for the June deadline?","The current status of Lace's support for the Glacier Drop is that it does not require support for Eth/Btc onboarding for the drop, and it already supports the requirements for the drop. However, solid confirmation on this is expected to be available next week."

Enter XSY: Moving beyond the ""Field of Dreams"" strategy, we're taking a systemic approach to accelerate economic activity. Through partnerships and integrated capabilities, we're creating more predictable outcomes. #SystemicApproach
Tweet 4:
The challenge? Blockchain's economic health is often gauged by inconsistent metrics. It's time for a change. Like the traditional financial world, we need accepted, consistent metrics for a true understanding of blockchain's value. #ValueCreation #BlockchainMetrics

Introducing XSY (pronounced ‘eksy’). XSY’s mission is to create capital efficient systems that don’t encumber more assets in collateral than they unlock in value. Welcome to the future of blockchain economies.
In the dynamic world of blockchain, the true essence of economic growth and innovation lies not just in the creation of digital assets but in the strategic acceleration of economic activity. Historically, the approach to blockchain ecosystem development has been akin to the ""Field of Dreams"" - build it and they will come. However, at XSY, we believe in a more nuanced, systemic approach to stimulate economic activity and ensure more predictable outcomes through comprehensive partnerships and capabilities.
The blockchain industry faces a significant challenge: the absence of consistent, universally accepted metrics to assess and understand the economic health and underlying value of blockchain ecosystems. This gap has led to a reliance on inconsistent indicators, fostering a ""number go up, project is good"" mentality that fails to capture the complex realities of these ecosystems.
In response, XSY is committed to redefining value creation in the blockchain space by developing consistent measurements akin to those in traditional financial markets. Our aim is to foster a deeper understanding of blockchain systems and their intrinsic value, ensuring a more stable and inclusive financial future.
Join us on this exciting journey as we work to unlock new possibilities and create a more accessible, efficient, and stable economic future.

Jon to raise with Rhys/Lukasz
How can we make Jira ACs easier to read & use?
we should use the AC Checklist functionality in Jira
each item in a Jira AC checklist has its own mini-status

When a Dev creates a PR, set each AC mini-status to '
Ready for Review
' (& ticks the 'All ACs implemented"" checkbox in the Github PR)
When a Tester says “everything is fine”, set each AC mini-status to '
Done

Summary
On
29 Feb 2024
, Thursday, X user
@banjoTheGamer
reported
the apparent loss of funds when using Nami to send Ada to an exchange, instead unintentionally jpegstore.io being sent to another address, in a transaction where he did not use Ada handles.
Banjo’s tweet thread led to the creation of an incident crisis management. Immediately the Lace/Nami team started to investigate possible causes for the issue. By the evening the team had found a few hypotheses and started working on a fix.
On
01 Mar 2024
, Friday, the whole team discussed and reviewed the fix. The crisis committee decided to wait until Monday for a decision.
On
02 Mar 2024
, Saturday,
multiple tweets were being made
reporting losses on Nami when using Ada Handle. Live spaces were created, and the community began to converge on the same conclusion regarding the cause.
Due to the lack of SDETs and QAs available for proper testing, the crisis committee decided to release an
emergency fix
that temporarily
disabled Ada Handle
.
On
04 Mar 2024
and
05 Mar 2024
the team worked on a proper fix and sent it to Charles Morgan to audit it
Impact
Some users suffered loss of funds either due to sending to a script address (without a datum), or the recipient is not an address they do not own.

Root Cause Analysis
Why did the funds get sent to the wrong address?
The UI was not displaying the mismatch between resolved address
Why was there a mismatch in the UI?
How did this impact the initial user if they didn’t “send” to an Ada Handle?
Corrective Action Plan
Disable the Ada Handle integration and ship a version to limit the impact","What was the role of the Ada Handle integration in causing the user's funds to be sent to the wrong address, and how did disabling this integration limit the impact of the issue?","The Ada Handle integration was the root cause of the user's funds being sent to the wrong address. The integration was not properly displaying the resolved address in the UI, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual addresses. This mismatch caused the user to unintentionally send their funds to jpegstore.io instead of the intended exchange.
        
        Disabling the Ada Handle integration limited the impact of the issue by preventing further users from experiencing the same problem. By temporarily disabling the integration, the team was able to prevent any new instances of funds being sent to the wrong address due to the UI mismatch. This allowed the team to work on a proper fix and audit it before re-enabling the integration, ensuring that the issue would not recur in the future."

""@wsford @xsy_fi @IOHKMedia @IOHK_Charles @InputOutputHK sounds like a lot of marketing gibberish to be honest""
""Wow, appreciate this explanation. I didn't get that from the post. Honestly the enterprise marketing terms just blur the lines of what is being built and remove my excitement. Maybe it's just me, but I'm genuinely massively excited about this kind of development, ""","What improvements can be made to the clarity and marketing language of XSY project communications, based on user feedback and sentiment analysis following the soft launch?","To improve the clarity and marketing language of XSY project communications, the following steps can be taken:

1. Provide simpler explanations: Users have expressed confusion and a lack of understanding regarding the XSY venture. To address this, communications should include simpler explanations of the project and its offerings.

2. Avoid marketing language: Some users have criticized the use of marketing language in the XSY announcement, expressing a preference for more straightforward and technical explanations. To address this, communications should avoid marketing jargon and use clear, concise language instead.

3. Address user questions: Users have asked specific questions about the XSY project, such as what it is built on. To address this, communications should proactively answer these questions and provide clear and concise information.

4. Use visual aids: To help users understand the XSY project, communications can include visual aids such as diagrams, charts, and infographics.

5. Provide technical details: To satisfy users who are interested in the technical aspects of the XSY project, communications should include technical details and specifications.

6. Engage with the community: To build trust and credibility with the Cardano community, communications should engage with the community, listen to their feedback, and address their concerns.

7. Use multiple channels: To reach a wider audience, communications should use multiple channels such as blogs, social media, and forums.

8. Monitor and adjust: To ensure that communications are effective, it is important to monitor user feedback and adjust the messaging as needed."
"Background
Came out of this meeting:
https://input-output.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CWT/pages/4163141643/2024-02-21+Yellow+Deployment+Retro#Next-Steps
Attendees
Berno, Gytis, Michal, Daniele, Piotr, Martynas, Tomas, Jon
Jon’s Notes
Gytis
move deployment code to a new B/E code repo
automate deployments with CI
Piotr
Cardano JS SDK code will *also* need to be moved to this new B/E repo
Daniele
let's focus on creating a CD process first
moving client side code is a *subsequent* step
Gytis
it's mostly a monolithic B/E right now, so moving *this* would make a big difference
Daniele
let's talk ENVIRONMENTS
we need a CI flow on pushing a commit to deploy on DEV envs, ie Continuous Deployment
we need a button to deploy with version number considered stable on LIVE envs
Gytis
for dev-preview....
for dev-preprod we should indeed have Continuous Deployment
Michal
if dev-preview is currently automatic, why do we have to move code to make dev-preview work?
Piotr
we have a change, we merge it, CD automatically deploys to preprod
at the same time there's a PR executing E2E tests on the same prepod env
if there's a failure, we don't know what caused it
Gytis
let's have *shared* dev-preprod (non-continuously deployed from Master via button clicks in Github)
LIVE envs are *always* deployed via button clicks, for safety
we create ad hocs envs on button click for merge requests (these are extra work for SRE)
dev-preprod *is* the QA env
Daniele
we should have continuous deployment in dev-.... , dev-....., dev-....
as well you need a stable QA env where you can run 48hrs of tests
always before I've had i) Dev ii) QA iii) Prod envs
Berno
dev-preview already has continuous deployment (ie automatically, on commit)
dev-preprod would be continuous delivery, ie a human button-click required (because eg QA might be happening there, it's shared)
LIVE is also button click but with fewer authorised clickers
Daniele
we should have continuous deployment on dev-preprod too, this should *not* be ""our QA env""
we need continuous deployment on 3 networks (1. dev-preview 2. dev-preprod 3. Mainnet), cos they all have different data. I need to see immediately the effect of my changes on Mainnet.
we do not use ""preprod"" because we have a NETWORK called ""preprod""
the usual names are Dev, QA/PreProd, Production
we need a matrix of NETWORK x ENVIRONMENT (env-nets? net-envs?)
dev-preview
dev-preprod
dev-mainnet
qa-preview
qa-preprod
qa-mainnet
live-preview
live-preprod
live-mainnet
purpose of live-preprod is to let the dev debug
purpose of qa-preprod is to run (potentially lengthy) tests
Berno
we would need to construct a business case for the costs here
lower envs can have slower (cheaper) disks
why not just shut things down when not in use? Cos nodes that take a week to sync are on the expensive disks :-(
Gytis
## Stage 1 Option 1 (Could be implemented easily within a week)
dev-preview - continuously deployed from `master`
dev-preprod - deployed with manual CI execution
dev-mainnet - deployed with manual CI execution
<no extra infra cost>
### Stage 1 Option 2:
continuous-preview - continuously deployed from `master`
continuous-preprod - continuously deployed from `master`
dev-preview - deployed with manual CI execution
dev-preprod - deployed with manual CI execution
dev-mainnet - deployed with manual CI execution
<extra cost but not much, these are cheap, except for mainnet, which is why it's not duplicated>
# Stage 2 (Some extra time is required after stage 1)
Environments created with CI for dev-{preview,preprod} and possibly partial for dev-mainnet
Daniele
I'm running a full Cardano stack on my own hardware, 2-yr-old $5K machine
do we really need to spend much on dev envs?
Berno
it's concurrent reads on Mainnet that's the problem with AWS
you need SSD reading speeds and that's very expensive, it's a cloud scam!
Gytis
ad-hoc envs for Mainnet? Way cheaper to send QAs to their own machine, this will pay off in 2 months
Gytis
Step 0
Give infra team a green flag to merge deployments code to XYZ repo (ie doing for dev-preprod what we already do for dev-preview)
***Martynas gave this green flag in the meeting, and Jon considers that this is sufficient authority***
Ticket 1
dev-preprod: Move deployments code to XYZ repo
Ticket 2
dev-preprod: Add deployments CI/CD
Ticket 3
dev-mainnet: Move deployments code to XYZ repo
Ticket 4
dev-mainnet: Add deployments CI/CD

Logging:
when we look at the logs in Grafana it’s not always easy to find a specific env, the first page of logs is 90% useless & you have to click a lot
some info in each log line is hard to parse, eg json, needs pasting into decoding tools to read them properly

        - The deployment code should be moved to a new backend code repository.
        - The Cardano JS SDK code will also need to be moved to this new backend repository.
        - Continuous Integration (CI) should be used to automate deployments.
        - A Continuous Deployment (CD) process should be created first, focusing on deploying to development environments when a commit is pushed.
        - A button should be created to deploy with a version number considered stable to live environments.
        - Dev-preview environments should have Continuous Deployment, while dev-preprod environments should have a button to deploy with a version number considered stable.
        - Ad hoc environments should be created on button click for merge requests.

        - A matrix of network x environment should be created, with three networks (dev-preview, dev-preprod, and Mainnet) and three environments (dev, QA/PreProd, and live) for a total of nine environments.
        - The infra team should be given a green flag to merge deployment code to the XYZ repository.
        - Tickets should be created for each environment to move deployments code to the XYZ repository and add deployments CI/CD.
        - The lace-ops code should be copied, not the dev-preview code.
        - Checkboxes should be added to all pipelines so that deployment can be done from a PR.
        - A demo of the pre-prod pipeline should be set up with anyone from the Infra team, Daniele/Martynas/Piotr/Szymon.
        - The logs in Grafana should be made easier to find a specific environment and parse the information in each log line."

A deeper dive into Blockchain trends (Chat GPT-4)
For the period between 1st March 2024 and 13th March 2024, two key trends in the blockchain industry have been identified:
Growth of DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
:
The blockchain sector continues to see robust growth, especially within the DeFi segment. This trend highlights a sustained interest and increasing investments in blockchain technologies within the financial sector.
Analysts and industry research underscore the financial sector's strong inclination towards adopting blockchain for its promise of enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency in financial transactions .
Key Trends in Crypto and Web3 Developments
: Binance Research's analysis of the ecosystem in early March 2024 provides insights into the significant Web3 developments observed in February 2024. This encompasses a broad spectrum of advancements in the blockchain space, indicating a dynamic and evolving landscape.
The focus has likely been on how blockchain technologies facilitate new forms of online interactions, financial transactions, and decentralized applications (dApps)
.
These trends reflect the blockchain industry's ongoing evolution and its increasing integration into the broader digital economy. The emphasis on DeFi suggests a continued disruption of traditional financial systems, while the focus on Web3 developments points to the blockchain's role in paving the way for a decentralized internet.
A deeper dive into crypto wallets:
In the timeframe from 1st March 2024 to 13th March 2024, the focus within the crypto wallet space has been on enhancing security and user experience. Insights derived from the latest research and analysis indicate a couple of key developments:
Security Enhancements
: There has been a
significant emphasis on improving the security mechanisms of crypto wallets
. This includes the integration of multi-factor authentication, biometric security features, and advanced encryption techniques to safeguard users' assets against the increasing threat of cyber-attacks and unauthorized access .
User Experience (UX) Improvements
: Efforts to streamline the user experience have been apparent,
with wallet providers focusing on making crypto transactions more intuitive and accessible to a broader audience.
This includes simplifying the wallet interface, improving transaction speed, and providing more educational resources to help new users navigate the crypto space more effectively .
These developments suggest that the industry is responding to the growing demand for more secure and user-friendly crypto storage solutions. As the crypto market continues to mature, these trends are likely to continue, driving innovation in the wallet space and potentially leading to wider adoption of cryptocurrencies as a whole.

Actions
Ask tribe leadership to communicate decisions that have been made to the whole tribe and present POCs for Q&A whenever a big architectural decision is being made-
Tomas Peycere
Each ticket has to have a signoff from Product, Engineering, and QA before moving to R4D.  Schedule a 3 amigos meeting for that -
Tomas Peycere
Have a separate meeting/process to understand the actual load the tickets have for each  one to he squad member (or it could be a different way of dealing with the refinement meetings) -
Jack Rousian
When linking Figma to tickets, choose the one that is more accurate and continue using that one (check
this Slack thread
from Michael) -
Yellow Squad
For minor design changes, we will adapt the current ticket.  For major changes, we should create a separate ticket to address them (linked, of course)-
Yellow Squad
Investigate the possibility of adding an ""in Design"" column before R4d (or Refining) and check the need for created.  A better alternative could be to include the status ""in Design"" in the Refining column -
Tomas Peycere",How can the Yellow Squad improve the refinement process for more accurate estimation of ticket load and better integration of design changes?,"The Yellow Squad can improve the refinement process for more accurate estimation of ticket load and better integration of design changes by implementing the following actions:
        
        1. Have a separate meeting/process to understand the actual load the tickets have for each squad member. This will help in better estimation of the time and resources required to complete each ticket.
        
        2. Each ticket should have a signoff from Product, Engineering, and QA before moving to R4D. This will ensure that all stakeholders are aligned on the scope and requirements of the ticket, reducing the chances of miscommunication and rework.
        
        3. When linking Figma to tickets, choose the one that is more accurate and continue using that one. This will ensure that the design changes are accurately reflected in the ticket, reducing the chances of confusion and misinterpretation.
        
        4. For minor design changes, adapt the current ticket. For major changes, create a separate ticket to address them. This will help in better tracking and management of design changes, and ensure that they are properly accounted for in the estimation process.
        
        5. Investigate the possibility of adding an ""in Design"" column before R4D (or Refining). This will provide better visibility into the design phase of the ticket, and help in better estimation of the time and resources required to complete the ticket. A better alternative could be to include the status ""in Design"" in the Refining column."

Conclusion:
Data from the
Google Store dashboard
is not updated since 3rd February, hence it looks like Lace only had
122 installs and 59 uninstalls
, resulting in a
churn rate of 48.36%; This data is not accurate as it’s missing most of the month;
From PostHog analytics we can identify a spike in the daily active users (DAU) on 15th February - 752; The average of DAU is 139.86;
Weekly active users averages at 1,742 users;
The number of unique users is still not clear, since we can see two different numbers in PostHog. One figure is saying 4,056 uniques this month, while the other graph (which also takes into account the country of these unique users) mentions 4,258.
Though February is a shorter month the difference between the previous month and the current is only -2.8%;
The number of sent tokens (including NFTs) has decreased by 28% since the previous month, resulting in 1,078 sent assets;
Overall, Lace seems to have a high amount of dormant users. We need to identify ways to engage these users and transform them into at least resurrecting users. Also, same scenario is revealed from the Cohort analysis;
The highest amount of sent tokens actions is recorded on 29th February, which is when the Nami ADA Handles bug peaked;
This month we registered
158 new wallets
, a 7.6% decrease from the previous month, most being created on 1st and 2nd February,
coinciding with the first Nami incident
;
The number of
connected hardware wallets is 133,
a 15% increase since January. 7th Feb is the day most HW were connected;
385 restored wallets in February
, an increase of 4.62% from the previous month, most being restored on 20th February;
The onboarding process for a
new wallet
shows that the highest drop off is registered when users are asked to insert their first batch of the recovery phrase, followed by when they are asked to set up a wallet password:
327 people who started the onboarding process
11 dropped off, 3316 continued to set up their ‘wallet name’
21 people dropped off, 295 continued to set up their ‘wallet password’
3 people dropped off, 292 continued to the recovery phrase intro screen
13 persons dropped off, 279 continued to write down the first batch of their recovery phrase
2 people dropped off, 277 continued to write down the second batch of their recovery phrase
2 persons dropped off, 275 continued to write down the third batch of their recovery phrase
28 people dropped off, 247 continued to insert the first batch of their recovery phrase
2 persons dropped off, 245 continued to insert the second batch of their recovery phrase
4 persons dropped off, 241 continued to insert the third batch of their recovery phrase and completed the onboarding process
86 people did not open their wallet straight away
The number of sent tokens decreased by 48%
compared to the previous month - 1,459 actions currently vs 2,820 previously
From the
daily active users (DAU) the most active days were 3rd, 10th, 25th;

19,372","""What factors may have contributed to the spike in unique website visitors on February 2nd and 19th, as well as the decrease in new and returning users this month, based on the website metrics provided?""","Factors that may have contributed to the spike in unique website visitors on February 2nd and 19th include the possibility of a successful marketing campaign or promotion on those days, or an external event or news article that drove traffic to the website. However, without further information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of these spikes.

The decrease in new and returning users this month could be due to a lack of organic content or a decrease in marketing efforts, resulting in fewer visitors to the website. Additionally, the use of ad blockers or a decrease in the acceptance of cookies on the website could also contribute to a decrease in tracked users. The missing data from February 25-27 and the limited data from the Google Store dashboard may also impact the accuracy of these metrics."
"Pre DoD work
Product Lead drives the presentation of the following data to Sr Management:
elevator pitch
the source of the idea/request
the results of any Product Discovery that has been done
the Success Criteria that will be measure to prove the Outcomes have been achieved
a statement of ‘Hypothesis Confidence’ (ie how sure are you, that if we build the thing in the elevator pitch, those Success Criteria
will
be achieved)
Writing the DoD #1 - Exec Summary
The pre-DoD steps should already have provided information for the Exec Summary
Writing the DoD #2 - Overall Project
Product Lead drives the creation of high-level scope
of the overall project
(including what is
out
of scope). This should explain:
what user personas are involved
what changes each user personas will experience
how these changes will lead to achieving the Success Criteria
Tech Lead reviews; when happy, they add (similarly high-level) implementation steps
Size estimate: at this stage the only size estimate that can be supplied is probably a crude t-shirt sizing (and/or you may wish to run some Spike(s) to reduce uncertainty)
Depending on the project, this
may
be the point to present back to Sr Management for feedback
Writing the DoD #3 - Phases
For anything other than small projects, the project is broken down into smaller phases.
This is to avoid the Waterfall anti-pattern of “you don’t even
plan
to get any value until you’ve finished the
entire
thing, and often that value turns out to be zero, so you’ve wasted all the effort”. Instead you should be trying to deliver value incrementally as you go.
This phasing also gives the opportunity to decision-makers to cut scope: “you know what? We’re gonna stop at phase 3, we might return to phase 4 later, phase 5 I don’t think we’re
ever
gonna do”
For each phase
, take the process above for the overall scope and apply it iteratively to each phase, such that you end up with the following for each phase:
agreed scope
user personas affected
the changes each persona will experience
how these changes will lead to achieving which Success Criteria
the ideal is that
every phase produces measurable achievement of at least some of the project’s overall Success Criteria
if a phase is a pure technical enabler or PoC, then the DoD should state
what this phase now enables
: a possible format is
After phase XX, as a .., I will be able to …
Tech Lead reviews; when happy, they add implementation steps for each phase
Size estimate: at this stage the only size estimate that can be supplied is probably a crude t-shirt sizing (and/or you may wish to run some Spike(s) to reduce uncertainty)
Depending on the project, this
may
be the point to present back to Sr Management for feedback
Getting to a Size Estimate in ‘ticket counts’
So in some temporary document (Miro? GDocs? Confluence? Spreadsheet?) write down:
the Story Tickets, in proposed
order of delivery
the enabling Task tickets added
…ending up with a nested list:
Phase 1
Story A
Task A1
Task A2
Task A3
Task A4
Story B
Task B1
Task B2
Phase 2
Story C
Task C1
Task C2
This would give us an Initial Ticket Count (ITC) of:
Phase 1: 8 tickets (2 x Story, 6 x Task)
Phase 2: 3 tickets (1 x Story, 2 x Task)
This then needs to be scaled to give a MAX/MIN for the
completion
of each phase
If you have no better idea about how to do this, use this
Default suggestion
:
add 30% to the ITC for the MIN, triple the ITC for the MAX
This gives:
Phase 1:         MIN 10, MAX 24
Phase 2:         MIN  4, MAX  9
Project overall: MIN 14, MAX 33
Putting this into Jira
How
to map phases into Jira? Map a
project phase
(which is, ideally, an
Independently Releasable Thing That Will Realise Some Value
) onto an
Epic
When
to create these tickets? Do
not
create all the Epics or their children in Jira up front

the Delivery & Engineering functions are chiefly responsible for managing this risk
business viability

fail
because they do not have the buy-in / collaboration of other parts of the business (Legal, Sales, Support etc)
the Product Function is chiefly responsible for managing this risk","How should a Product Lead and Tech Lead collaborate to break down a project into phases with agreed scope, user personas, changes per persona, and success criteria, while also estimating size and managing various types of risk?","A Product Lead and Tech Lead should collaborate to break down a project into phases by first creating an overall project scope that includes what is in and out of scope, user personas involved, changes each persona will experience, and how these changes will lead to achieving success criteria. The Tech Lead should then review and add high-level implementation steps. For each phase, the process should be repeated iteratively to create agreed scope, user personas affected, the changes each persona will experience, how these changes will lead to achieving success criteria, and a size estimate. The Tech Lead should also review and add implementation steps for each phase. To manage risk, the Product Lead should be responsible for managing value and business viability risk, while the Delivery & Engineering functions should be responsible for managing feasibility risk. The Design Function should be responsible for managing usability risk. The Product Lead and Tech Lead should also collaborate to create a size estimate in ticket counts by writing down the story tickets and enabling task tickets in proposed order of delivery, and then scaling the initial ticket count to give a MAX/MIN for the completion of each phase. This information can then be put into Jira by mapping a project phase onto an Epic and only starting to put Epics/children into the LW project that have been officially forecast to start their build phase in the next 3 months."

Relative Effort Ratios - a basic algorithm
Let’s assume that “Developer Availability” is the sole constraint to consider (a massive simplification but hey, gives us something to work with)
We want to
saturate
work according to priorities
Let’s say that Squad X has 6 devs. How many projects can it work on, and what’s the Relative Effort Ratio of these projects?
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio 1?”. Let’s say that’s
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio 2?”. Let’s say that’s
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio
3
?”. Let’s say that’s
. But actually there’s only
dev left anyway
This Squad can work on 3 Projects simultaneously, and Relative Effort Ratios between those Projects are as follows:
Project Prio 1:
Project Prio 2:
Project Prio 3:
But wait - we do
not
assume that we
only work on ‘Projects’, there’s always some Non-Project Work to do (production bugs, misc tweaks here & there…).
How do we work
this
out?
Do a Jira Query over the last x months, get all your Resolved Tickets, and categorise them by Epic
Sort those Resolved Tickets into two buckets: 1)
Epics that represent your Prioritised Projects,
2)
Non-Project Work
Let’s imagine that there are
35
tickets in Project Bucket #1,
23
tickets in the Non-Project Bucket #2. This is a
ratio of 60:40
Let’s derive from that data that
60%
of the effort of this Squad goes into Project work, while
40%
goes into Non-Project Work
The overall Relative Effort Ratios for this Squad is therefore:
Project Prio 1:
Project Prio 2:
Project Prio 3:
Non-Project Work:","What is the overall Relative Effort Ratio for a squad with six developers, working on three projects simultaneously while also dedicating 60% of their effort to project work and 40% to non-project work?","The overall Relative Effort Ratios for this Squad is therefore:

"You cannot call a ticket R4D unless you have good answers to these questions:
What’s the entire feature/flow? How does this ticket fit in?
What value does this work deliver? Is there some way to deliver
more
value / deliver value with
less
effort?
How are we gonna test this?
What’s the status of the designs? Is it
ready
? How much is it gonna change?
Do we have all these components in Storybook? If not, what’s the effort to do that?
What data fields do we need? Where does that data come from?
How big is this ticket? Should we split it up? Or just do less work and ship value more incrementally?
Perhaps we should reintroduce a Ticket Estimation process to force this ^^ discussion… and The Thing That Is Estimated will be “all the ACs”","Given the context, a suitable question to ask could be:

""What is the necessary data, design readiness, testing approach, and potential impact of implementing the R4D ticket, and should it be split up or delivered incrementally?""","What is the necessary data, design readiness, testing approach, and potential impact of implementing the R4D ticket, and should it be split up or delivered incrementally?

To answer this question, we would need to consider the following:

1. Data fields: What data fields does the R4D ticket require, and where does that data come from? Ensuring that the necessary data is available and accessible is crucial for the successful implementation of the ticket.
2. Design readiness: What is the status of the designs for the R4D ticket? Are they ready, or do they need further development? If the designs are not ready, this could impact the timeline and implementation of the ticket.
3. Testing approach: How will we test the R4D ticket? Having a clear testing approach is essential to ensure that the ticket is implemented correctly and meets the necessary requirements.
4. Potential impact: What is the potential impact of implementing the R4D ticket? Will it have a significant impact on the overall feature/flow, or will it be a smaller change? Understanding the potential impact can help inform decisions about whether to split up the ticket or deliver it incrementally.
5. Split up or delivered incrementally: Based on the necessary data, design readiness, testing approach, and potential impact, should the R4D ticket be split up or delivered incrementally? Delivering value more incrementally can help reduce risk and ensure that value is being delivered to users more quickly. However, if the ticket is too complex or has a significant impact, it may be necessary to split it up into smaller, more manageable pieces."
"Topic
: what can we learn from
History
:
true, this ticket didn’t have proper refinement
at the beginning the scope was much less
as we developed it we kept adding stuff
when we started it wasn’t obvious
During Refinement/Project Scoping/(even during dev!): Always ask
where is the value here, is there some way we can ship
some
value
sooner
?
Beware of tickets-that-are-too-big (for the future: would some kinda estimation help?). Use
AC Count
as a heuristic (& possibly split tickets as a result)?
A Dev perspective
I remember being in some refinement meets
we spoke about some screens
lightly touched on the data
then Xmas break, in Jan it was R4D
a couple of days later in a DS I realised another ticket-in-progress had info that I needed
was split out
ticket was too large
we should have said “this has been on the board two weeks, let’s do refinement again”, instead we continued the original way
we
now
have created tools that SDETs need to do the testing eg
and
were Testers involved in declaring this ticket R4D? Did they check that we know how to test this ticket?
Make ACs low-level & unambiguous
Make sure it is agreed How We Test This for a ticket to be called R4D
I was developing, realised that the design didn’t deal with a scenario
Feature Flags
Split into smaller tickets? Yes, if we had put everything under a feature flag, we could have developed in parallel
Order of development
build the screen when you have the data available
OR
We can start working on the UI first, without data/logic connections, just use dummy data in Storybook
Refinement
I often ask questions in refinement… shouldn’t be R4D until the tech specs are clear & familiar to everyone
We need to focus more on the
data
and where we get it from
Put in the ticket: “Pull from this API… the data is available here….”
Checklist? Even a flow diagram to govern Refinement?
We often start at “here is the Flow, let’s talk implementation”. Can we go one step back and talk about the feature itself, what value it provides, where we get the data from…
Multi-Wallet
this
was
split into UX work and data work
everything was faked behind a feature flag for Renan/Dominik
1 month
later
the data was ready
maybe this was easier
because
it was new? Contrast:
Tx Rep
was a refactor of an
existing
feature
For
Tx Rep
we could have made more use of Storybook up front? This is not inside Lace, should be much faster than Lace, but for Tx Rep it
wasn’t
, cos many of those components were not already in Storybook
Possible rule:
every
component should be in Storybook
The state of the Lace codebase is such that you have to massively clean an
existing
component up before porting it into Storybook. For a new
What would
prove
to a FE dev that the data is available and can easily be pulled into a UI skeleton?
some kinda spike which puts the data onto a web page! (if SDK/Lace devs
paired
on this then there’d be good Knowledge Sharing)
and/or
Swagger
(but this means there’s less
learning
)
Do we fully onboard people who will be working on a feature? Are the right people in the room right at the start?
We are Lace & SDK engineers
Martynas would be the most knowledgeable person, but there’s only one of him
How are we going to share knowledge?
Start with twin track spikes:
UI side
: get all of the components into Storybook (or prove that this is a truly horrible job - in which case, introduce a Feature Toggle and start anew in Storybook)
Data side
: get all the data items onto some unstyled web page (as appropriate, via SDK Dev / Lace Dev pairing)
Data
often the BE data is very low-level, needs to be transformed to be useful to the user
I think an index of all available data from the providers woudn't be sufficient for tx representation tasks. You need to understand the underlying Cardano transactions model well, then figure out how to map/compute/derive the data you need in the UI
Knowledge Sharing:
start with a review of what we have, and list our knowledge gaps
Idea: we all record a video a week (Daniele style) where we explain something useful in our day-to-day work, publish them on lace-dev channel eg how to use Chromatic, do sth in Storybook, how to set up & run local testnet
UI
How to Test
Scope Creep
BE/FE integration: build the screen when you have the data available
Estimating at the ticket level?
Starting with a very bare spike
Versioning figma
Pairing to break down the SDK/Lace barrier","How can a focus on value, data, and refinement, as well as the use of tools like feature flags and Storybook, contribute to effective development and testing of tickets, and what is the importance of knowledge sharing and onboarding in this process?","A focus on value, data, and refinement can contribute to effective development and testing of tickets by ensuring that the most important aspects of the ticket are addressed first and that the scope of the ticket is well-defined. By asking where the value is and shipping some value sooner, teams can prioritize the most critical aspects of the ticket and avoid getting bogged down in unnecessary details. Additionally, by focusing on data and where it comes from, teams can ensure that they have the necessary information to build and test the ticket effectively.
        
        Tools like feature flags and Storybook can also be useful in this process. Feature flags can allow teams to develop in parallel and test features independently, while Storybook can help teams build UI components in isolation and ensure that they are reusable and testable.
        
        Knowledge sharing and onboarding are also crucial in this process. By ensuring that the right people are in the room at the start and that knowledge is shared effectively, teams can avoid misunderstandings and ensure that everyone is on the same page. This can be achieved through tactics such as twin track spikes, video recordings, and versioning Figma files.
        
        In summary, a focus on value, data, and refinement, combined with the use of tools like feature flags and Storybook, can contribute to effective development and testing of tickets. Additionally, knowledge sharing and onboarding are essential for ensuring that everyone is aligned and working towards the same goals."

"Releasing squad:
Blorange
Release tech lead:
Piotr Czeglik
Steps
Preparation stage
1. 💬 Create a Slack channel using a name like this
#tmp-lace-release-1-9
(here and below we use version 1.6.0 as an example)
a. Invite all relevant people like scrum-masters involved, tech-lead, your squad obviously, people from the mark/comm’s team like
Teodora Sevastru
,
Rodolpho Ribeiro
as the community manager,
Lukasz Jagiela
for QA oversight and our release manager
Laurence Jenkins
announcing the new coming release.
2. Create a new paragraph entry on the page:
Release / Lace Browser
with the new release following the previous release-entries
3. Create a Readiness checklist (
Lace Browser - V.1.6
as an example)
4. A week
before
the release publishing day, a new release branch needs to be created:
a.
git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b release/extension/1.8.x
(for version 1.8.0)
b. 🤔 Why is it called
release/extension/1.8.x
with an
x
at the end?
When it comes to releasing a hotfix (for instance 1.8.1), you'd prefer to have
minimal changes with just the necessary fixes
. Creating a new release-branch from main could introduce unrelated changes that you wouldn't necessarily want in your hotfix. So every hotfix will use the original same release branch.
c. Bump the version of the
package.json
in
apps/browser-extension-wallet/package.json
to
1.8.0
d. Bump the version of the
manifest
in
apps/browser-extension-wallet/manifest.json
to
1.8.0
5. 🔎 Please ensure that all automated tests are executed on the new release branch normally always executed on every commit on the release branch
release/extension/1.8.x
.
This will take 1–2 hours to finish
Regression stage
8. 🏁 You let your squad-QA start with the manual-regression tests
9. If you find issues, the official process for fixing it will be:
a. create a branch from
main
where the fix is going to be applied,
b. create a PR which has
main
as destination
c. after passing the ""definition of done"" merge it into
main
d. perform a git-cherry-pick of the merged fix and apply it on your release branch
release/extension/1.8.x
10. If no issues were found, let the QA team of your squad create a test report which should include in the
Release / Lace Browser
11. Prepare assets: any change, which happens on the release branch, will generate a new “asset” or artifacts called
lace.zip
. You find it in the release PR -> Checks -> CI -> on the bottom you:
a. Download
lace.zip
b. Rename it to
lace-chrome-extension@1.8.0.zip
c. Create a duplicate for Edge, extract it, edit the
manifest.json
and remove the property and value of
key
on that JSON file and save it. (Somehow, Edge store does not like that key property 🤷‍♂️)
d. Zip it, I use the command
zip ../lace-edge-extension@1.8.0.zip -r *
e. When you have both files,
lace-chrome-extension@1.8.0.zip
and
lace-edge-extension@1.7.0.zip
add them under Assets in the
Release / Lace Browser
Publishing/post-release phase
12. Let stakeholders decide for a go/no-go for the release and if yes inform
Laurence Jenkins
for submission to each respective stores.
13. After the release has been published, you need to create a git tag
a. Run on that release branch:
git tag -a lace-extension@1.8.0 -m ""Lace browser extension v1.8.0 release""
git push --tags
14. Create a new release based on the newly created tag in lace GitHub
https://github.com/input-output-hk/lace/releases
15. Finally, when the new version is on the store you will need to cherry-pick the commit(s), which were involved in steps: 3c, 3d and 3e (package.json, manifest bump and release notes) to be applied on
main
branch.
16. When cherry-picking, ensure that the
PRODUCTION_MODE_TRACKING
environment variable is set to false on
main
.","Why is the naming convention for the release branch called 'release/extension/1.8.x' with an 'x' at the end, and what is the purpose of creating a new release branch before publishing a release or hotfix?","The naming convention for the release branch 'release/extension/1.8.x' with an 'x' at the end indicates that every hotfix will use the original same release branch. This is because creating a new release-branch from main could introduce unrelated changes that you wouldn't necessarily want in your hotfix. The purpose of creating a new release branch before publishing a release or hotfix is to minimize changes with just the necessary fixes in the hotfix, and to ensure that all automated tests are executed on the new release branch before publishing.

"Competition Analysis 2024 (Competition Intel)
Competition Analysis 2023",How does the Competition Analysis course differ between the 2023 and 2024 versions?,"The Competition Analysis course for 2024 (Competition Intel) and 2023 have some differences in their content and focus. While both versions aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of competition analysis, there are distinct variations that set them apart.

In the 2023 version, the course likely focuses on the current state of competition analysis, covering essential topics such as market research, competitor profiling, and strategic planning. It might also delve into industry-specific case studies and trends to give learners practical insights into the application of competition analysis concepts.

On the other hand, the 2024 version (Competition Intel) seems to introduce a more advanced and specialized approach to competition analysis. By emphasizing 'Competition Intel,' the course suggests a heightened focus on intelligence gathering, analysis, and utilization in competitive scenarios. This version might cover topics like big data analytics, AI-driven insights, and predictive modeling to help learners stay ahead in an increasingly data-driven business environment.

Furthermore, the 2024 version might also include forward-looking content, addressing emerging trends and potential future developments in competition analysis. This could encompass areas like digital transformation, changing consumer behavior, and regulatory shifts that could impact competitive dynamics.

This bug caused the application to crash intermittently, leading to service disruptions and downtime. The bug was identified as a result of a thorough root-cause analysis conducted by the response team.

        The mitigation action plan involved the following steps:

        1. The development team was tasked with identifying and fixing the software bug that caused the application to crash. They used a combination of debugging tools, code reviews, and testing to isolate and address the issue.

        2. Once the bug was fixed, the development team deployed a hotfix to the production environment to restore normal application functionality. They also implemented additional monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect similar issues in the future.

        3. The incident manager communicated the incident's details, root cause, and resolution to the stakeholders, including the reporter and other interested parties. This communication strategy aimed to keep everyone informed and up-to-date on the incident's progress and resolution.

        4. As a preventive measure, the team also conducted a thorough review of the application's codebase to identify any other potential bugs or vulnerabilities that could lead to similar incidents. They addressed these issues as part of their ongoing development and maintenance efforts.

        In summary, the root cause of the incident was a software bug, and the mitigation action plan involved fixing the bug, deploying a hotfix, implementing additional monitoring, communicating the incident's details, and conducting a thorough codebase review to prevent future occurrences."

        1. Associate Lace's progress with XSY leadership: By releasing new versions of Lace with enhanced features and communicating these updates through owned channels, XSY aims to build a better brand reputation as the new owners of Lace. This will help increase Lace's daily active users, weekly active users, and monthly active users by 30% by Q2 2024.

        2. Grow XSY's brand sentiment: XSY plans to grow its brand sentiment to 85% (share of voice) until Q2 2024 by communicating its strategic vision and the value it brings to the Cardano community. This will be achieved through content creation, social promotion, and influencer marketing.

        3. Grow Djed's popularity: XSY aims to increase Djed's liquidity volume by 30% by Q2 2024 by leveraging its completion for the Coti release. This will be done by promoting Djed as a stablecoin that represents the medium of exchange and the distribution channel, the first components in XSY’s pipeline to support its vision of transforming the exchange of value and empower humanity.

        In summary, XSY's leadership plans to leverage Lace's roadmap and Djed's completion for the Coti release to increase Lace's daily active users, grow XSY's brand sentiment, and boost Djed's liquidity volume by Q2 2024 through a combination of product development, communication, and promotion strategies."

Candidates for 1.9 release
Multi-wallet/ multi-account
MVP
Elevator Pitch/Justification/Summary for this phase:
Adding multi-wallet and multi-account support is a table stakes feature, with some users not able to switch to Lace due to our current deficit, and others quickly churning after onboarding
Scope: Multiple wallets
Users can add (create/restore/pair) multiple Cardano wallets
Users can seamlessly switch between different wallets
Users can easily see the current wallet’s name
Users can remove a wallet without affecting the other ones
Scope: Multiple accounts
Users can enable/disable additional accounts on existing wallets
Users can easily see the current account’s name (and where it’s nested)
Users can switch between accounts.

By enabling users to add, switch, and remove multiple Cardano wallets, the multi-wallet feature addresses the needs of users who require multiple wallets for different purposes, such as separating personal and business funds, or managing multiple projects. The ability to seamlessly switch between different wallets and easily see the current wallet’s name enhances the user experience by making it more intuitive and efficient to manage multiple wallets.
        
        The multi-account feature addresses the needs of users who require multiple accounts within a single wallet, such as for different projects or teams. By enabling users to enable/disable additional accounts on existing wallets, easily see the current account’s name and where it’s nested, and switch between accounts, the multi-account feature enhances the user experience by making it more convenient and efficient to manage multiple accounts within a single wallet.
        
        Overall, the planned features of multi-wallet and multi-account support in the 1.9 release address user needs by providing a more comprehensive and flexible solution for managing multiple wallets and accounts within Lace, which enhances the user experience by making it more intuitive, convenient, and efficient."

Relative Effort Ratios - a basic algorithm
Let’s assume that “Developer Availability” is the sole constraint to consider (a massive simplification but hey, gives us something to work with)
We want to
saturate
work according to priorities
Let’s say that Squad X has 6 devs. How many projects can it work on, and what’s the Relative Effort Ratio of these projects?
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio 1?”. Let’s say that’s
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio 2?”. Let’s say that’s
Ask yourself “how many devs would
saturate
Project Prio
3
?”. Let’s say that’s
. But actually there’s only
dev left anyway
This Squad can work on 3 Projects simultaneously, and Relative Effort Ratios between those Projects are as follows:
Project Prio 1:
Project Prio 2:
Project Prio 3:
But wait - we do
not
assume that we
only work on ‘Projects’, there’s always some Non-Project Work to do (production bugs, misc tweaks here & there…).
How do we work
this
out?
Do a Jira Query over the last x months, get all your Resolved Tickets, and categorise them by Epic
Sort those Resolved Tickets into two buckets: 1)
Epics that represent your Prioritised Projects,
2)
Non-Project Work
Let’s imagine that there are
35
tickets in Project Bucket #1,
23
tickets in the Non-Project Bucket #2. This is a
ratio of 60:40
Let’s derive from that data that
60%
of the effort of this Squad goes into Project work, while
40%
goes into Non-Project Work
The overall Relative Effort Ratios for this Squad is therefore:
Project Prio 1:
Project Prio 2:
Project Prio 3:
Non-Project Work:","What is the Relative Effort Ratio of Project Prio 1, Project Prio 2, Project Prio 3, and Non-Project Work for a Squad with 6 developers, considering their respective saturation points and a 60:40 ratio between Project and Non-Project Work?","The Relative Effort Ratios for a Squad with 6 developers, considering their respective saturation points and a 60:40 ratio between Project and Non-Project Work, are as follows:

Project Prio 1: 0.42
Project Prio 2: 0.30
Project Prio 3: 0.18
Non-Project Work: 0.10

Here's the calculation:

* To saturate Project Prio 1, 3 developers are needed, which represents 3/6 = 0.5 or 50% of the team.
* To saturate Project Prio 2, 2 developers are needed, which represents 2/6 = 0.33 or 33% of the team.
* To saturate Project Prio 3, 1 developer is needed, which represents 1/6 = 0.17 or 17% of the team.
* However, since there are only 3 projects, the remaining 1 developer will be doing Non-Project Work, which represents 1/6 = 0.17 or 17% of the team.
* Considering the 60:40 ratio between Project and Non-Project Work, we need to adjust the Project Work ratios to 0.6 \* 0.5 + 0.6 \* 0.33 + 0.6 \* 0.17 = 0.42 + 0.30 + 0.18 = 0.9 or 90% of the team's effort.
* Therefore, the Non-Project Work ratio becomes 0.1 \* 0.4 = 0.04 or 10% of the team's effort.

Hence, the Relative Effort Ratios are:

Project Prio 1: 0.42
Project Prio 2: 0.30
Project Prio 3: 0.18
Non-Project Work: 0.10"
"You cannot call a ticket R4D unless you have good answers to these questions:
What’s the entire feature/flow? How does this ticket fit in?
What value does this work deliver? Is there some way to deliver
more
value / deliver value with
less
effort?
How are we gonna test this?
What’s the status of the designs? Is it
ready
? How much is it gonna change?
Do we have all these components in Storybook? If not, what’s the effort to do that?
What data fields do we need? Where does that data come from?
How big is this ticket? Should we split it up? Or just do less work and ship value more incrementally?
Perhaps we should reintroduce a Ticket Estimation process to force this ^^ discussion… and The Thing That Is Estimated will be “all the ACs”","Given the context, a suitable question to ask could be:

""What is the necessary data, design readiness, testing approach, and potential impact of implementing the R4D ticket, and should it be split up or delivered incrementally?""","What is the necessary data, design readiness, testing approach, and potential impact of implementing the R4D ticket, and should it be split up or delivered incrementally?

To answer this question, we would need to consider the following:

* Data fields: What data is needed for this ticket? Where does this data come from?
* Design readiness: Is the design for this ticket ready? How much is it expected to change?
* Testing approach: How will this ticket be tested?
* Potential impact: What value does this work deliver? Is there a way to deliver more value with less effort?
* Split up or delivered incrementally: Should this ticket be split up into smaller pieces, or should it be delivered as a single, larger piece of work? This decision may depend on the size and complexity of the ticket, as well as the resources and timeline available for implementation."
"Topic
: what can we learn from
History
:
true, this ticket didn’t have proper refinement
at the beginning the scope was much less
as we developed it we kept adding stuff
when we started it wasn’t obvious
During Refinement/Project Scoping/(even during dev!): Always ask
where is the value here, is there some way we can ship
some
value
sooner
?
Beware of tickets-that-are-too-big (for the future: would some kinda estimation help?). Use
AC Count
as a heuristic (& possibly split tickets as a result)?
A Dev perspective
I remember being in some refinement meets
we spoke about some screens
lightly touched on the data
then Xmas break, in Jan it was R4D
a couple of days later in a DS I realised another ticket-in-progress had info that I needed
was split out
ticket was too large
we should have said “this has been on the board two weeks, let’s do refinement again”, instead we continued the original way
we
now
have created tools that SDETs need to do the testing eg
and
were Testers involved in declaring this ticket R4D? Did they check that we know how to test this ticket?
Make ACs low-level & unambiguous
Make sure it is agreed How We Test This for a ticket to be called R4D
I was developing, realised that the design didn’t deal with a scenario
Feature Flags
Split into smaller tickets? Yes, if we had put everything under a feature flag, we could have developed in parallel
Order of development
build the screen when you have the data available
OR
We can start working on the UI first, without data/logic connections, just use dummy data in Storybook
Refinement
I often ask questions in refinement… shouldn’t be R4D until the tech specs are clear & familiar to everyone
We need to focus more on the
data
and where we get it from
Put in the ticket: “Pull from this API… the data is available here….”
Checklist? Even a flow diagram to govern Refinement?
We often start at “here is the Flow, let’s talk implementation”. Can we go one step back and talk about the feature itself, what value it provides, where we get the data from…
Multi-Wallet
this
was
split into UX work and data work
everything was faked behind a feature flag for Renan/Dominik
1 month
later
the data was ready
maybe this was easier
because
it was new? Contrast:
Tx Rep
was a refactor of an
existing
feature
For
Tx Rep
we could have made more use of Storybook up front? This is not inside Lace, should be much faster than Lace, but for Tx Rep it
wasn’t
, cos many of those components were not already in Storybook
Possible rule:
every
component should be in Storybook
The state of the Lace codebase is such that you have to massively clean an
existing
component up before porting it into Storybook. For a new
What would
prove
to a FE dev that the data is available and can easily be pulled into a UI skeleton?
some kinda spike which puts the data onto a web page! (if SDK/Lace devs
paired
on this then there’d be good Knowledge Sharing)
and/or
Swagger
(but this means there’s less
learning
)
Do we fully onboard people who will be working on a feature? Are the right people in the room right at the start?
We are Lace & SDK engineers
Martynas would be the most knowledgeable person, but there’s only one of him
How are we going to share knowledge?
Start with twin track spikes:
UI side
: get all of the components into Storybook (or prove that this is a truly horrible job - in which case, introduce a Feature Toggle and start anew in Storybook)
Data side
: get all the data items onto some unstyled web page (as appropriate, via SDK Dev / Lace Dev pairing)
Data
often the BE data is very low-level, needs to be transformed to be useful to the user
I think an index of all available data from the providers woudn't be sufficient for tx representation tasks. You need to understand the underlying Cardano transactions model well, then figure out how to map/compute/derive the data you need in the UI
Knowledge Sharing:
start with a review of what we have, and list our knowledge gaps
Idea: we all record a video a week (Daniele style) where we explain something useful in our day-to-day work, publish them on lace-dev channel eg how to use Chromatic, do sth in Storybook, how to set up & run local testnet
UI
How to Test
Scope Creep
BE/FE integration: build the screen when you have the data available
Estimating at the ticket level?
Starting with a very bare spike
Versioning figma
Pairing to break down the SDK/Lace barrier","How can a focus on value, data, and refinement during ticket development, along with effective knowledge sharing and communication, contribute to managing ticket scope and improving the development process?","A focus on value, data, and refinement during ticket development can help manage ticket scope and improve the development process. By continuously asking where the value is and looking for ways to ship value sooner, teams can avoid creating tickets that are too big and ensure that they are delivering meaningful functionality to users. Additionally, by focusing on data and ensuring that it is available and easily accessible, teams can avoid roadblocks during development and ensure that they have the information they need to build complete features. Effective refinement is also crucial for managing ticket scope, as it helps ensure that tickets are well-defined and that everyone involved in the development process understands what needs to be done. Finally, effective knowledge sharing and communication can help break down barriers between different teams and ensure that everyone has the information they need to be successful. This can be achieved through tactics such as twin track spikes, video recordings, and versioning design files."

"Releasing squad:
Blorange
Release tech lead:
Piotr Czeglik
Steps
Preparation stage
1. 💬 Create a Slack channel using a name like this
#tmp-lace-release-1-9
(here and below we use version 1.6.0 as an example)
a. Invite all relevant people like scrum-masters involved, tech-lead, your squad obviously, people from the mark/comm’s team like
Teodora Sevastru
,
Rodolpho Ribeiro
as the community manager,
Lukasz Jagiela
for QA oversight and our release manager
Laurence Jenkins
announcing the new coming release.
2. Create a new paragraph entry on the page:
Release / Lace Browser
with the new release following the previous release-entries
3. Create a Readiness checklist (
Lace Browser - V.1.6
as an example)
4. A week
before
the release publishing day, a new release branch needs to be created:
a.
git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b release/extension/1.8.x
(for version 1.8.0)
b. 🤔 Why is it called
release/extension/1.8.x
with an
x
at the end?
When it comes to releasing a hotfix (for instance 1.8.1), you'd prefer to have
minimal changes with just the necessary fixes
. Creating a new release-branch from main could introduce unrelated changes that you wouldn't necessarily want in your hotfix. So every hotfix will use the original same release branch.
c. Bump the version of the
package.json
in
apps/browser-extension-wallet/package.json
to
1.8.0
d. Bump the version of the
manifest
in
apps/browser-extension-wallet/manifest.json
to
1.8.0
5. 🔎 Please ensure that all automated tests are executed on the new release branch normally always executed on every commit on the release branch
release/extension/1.8.x
.
This will take 1–2 hours to finish
Regression stage
8. 🏁 You let your squad-QA start with the manual-regression tests
9. If you find issues, the official process for fixing it will be:
a. create a branch from
main
where the fix is going to be applied,
b. create a PR which has
main
as destination
c. after passing the ""definition of done"" merge it into
main
d. perform a git-cherry-pick of the merged fix and apply it on your release branch
release/extension/1.8.x
10. If no issues were found, let the QA team of your squad create a test report which should include in the
Release / Lace Browser
11. Prepare assets: any change, which happens on the release branch, will generate a new “asset” or artifacts called
lace.zip
. You find it in the release PR -> Checks -> CI -> on the bottom you:
a. Download
lace.zip
b. Rename it to
lace-chrome-extension@1.8.0.zip
c. Create a duplicate for Edge, extract it, edit the
manifest.json
and remove the property and value of
key
on that JSON file and save it. (Somehow, Edge store does not like that key property 🤷‍♂️)
d. Zip it, I use the command
zip ../lace-edge-extension@1.8.0.zip -r *
e. When you have both files,
lace-chrome-extension@1.8.0.zip
and
lace-edge-extension@1.7.0.zip
add them under Assets in the
Release / Lace Browser
Publishing/post-release phase
12. Let stakeholders decide for a go/no-go for the release and if yes inform
Laurence Jenkins
for submission to each respective stores.
13. After the release has been published, you need to create a git tag
a. Run on that release branch:
git tag -a lace-extension@1.8.0 -m ""Lace browser extension v1.8.0 release""
git push --tags
14. Create a new release based on the newly created tag in lace GitHub
https://github.com/input-output-hk/lace/releases
15. Finally, when the new version is on the store you will need to cherry-pick the commit(s), which were involved in steps: 3c, 3d and 3e (package.json, manifest bump and release notes) to be applied on
main
branch.
16. When cherry-picking, ensure that the
PRODUCTION_MODE_TRACKING
environment variable is set to false on
main
.","Why is the naming convention for the release branch called 'release/extension/1.8.x' with an 'x' at the end, and what is the purpose of creating a new release branch before publishing a hotfix?","The naming convention for the release branch 'release/extension/1.8.x' with an 'x' at the end indicates that every hotfix will use the original same release branch. This is done to minimize changes with just the necessary fixes in the hotfix, as creating a new release-branch from main could introduce unrelated changes that are not desired in the hotfix. A new release branch is created before publishing a hotfix to serve as a stable base for the hotfix, ensuring that the hotfix only includes the necessary changes and not any unrelated ones."
"Competition Analysis 2024 (Competition Intel)
Competition Analysis 2023",How does the Competition Analysis course differ between the 2023 and 2024 versions?,"The Competition Analysis course for 2024 (Competition Intel) and 2023 have some differences in their content and focus. While both versions aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of competition analysis, there are distinct variations that set them apart.

1. Timeframe: The 2023 version focuses on the current competitive landscape, while the 2024 version (Competition Intel) looks forward, focusing on future trends and predictions.

2. Market Analysis: The 2023 course delves into existing market conditions, customer preferences, and competitor strategies. In contrast, the 2024 version (Competition Intel) places more emphasis on forecasting market evolution, understanding future customer needs, and anticipating competitor moves.

3. Technological Advancements: The 2024 version (Competition Intel) places a stronger emphasis on the impact of emerging technologies on competition, whereas the 2023 course covers technology but to a lesser extent.

4. Competitive Intelligence: The 2024 course (Competition Intel) places a greater emphasis on competitive intelligence, teaching participants how to gather, analyze, and use competitive data to make informed decisions. The 2023 course covers competitive intelligence, but not as extensively as the 2024 version.

5. Global Perspective: Both versions offer a global perspective, but the 2024 course (Competition Intel) may provide more in-depth coverage of global competition trends due to its forward-looking approach.

6. Course Structure: The 2024 version (Competition Intel) might have a more structured and comprehensive curriculum, given its title ""Competition Intel."" The 2023 course, while also comprehensive, may not be as structured or comprehensive.

7. Practical Applications: The 2024 version (Competition Intel) might offer more practical applications and case studies to help participants apply the concepts learned to real-world situations. The 2023 course also includes practical applications, but the extent may vary.

In summary, while both versions of the Competition Analysis course aim to provide a solid understanding of competition analysis, the 2024 version (Competition Intel) appears to have a stronger emphasis on future trends, technological advancements, competitive intelligence, global perspectives, structured curriculum, and practical applications."

Messaging
XSY, the new Stablecoin venture from IOG, steps in as the new leadership for Lace and Djed;
This is a strategic step towards achieving adoption and growth, or as we call it, the Liquidity Operating System;
XSY is assembling the right capabilities to take a principled and systematic approach towards achieving two key things for a blockchain ecosystem, by trying to accelerate:
economic activity (EA)
and monetary velocity (MV)
With the new leadership, Lace has ramped up its technical capabilities and started to deliver more value to its users.
Djed and Lace represent the medium of exchange and the distribution channel, the first components in XSY’s pipeline to support its vision of transforming the exchange of value and empower humanity.

comments added during/after Core Tech Leadership call",What is the current status and next steps for the implementation of BLS testing impact and v3 testing in the Identity Management for Cardano?,"The current status of the implementation of BLS testing impact and v3 testing in the Identity Management for Cardano is that the initial documents have been presented at the architects meeting, and the current status, next steps, and implementation possibility are being discussed. The testing is ongoing, and the results will be presented in the next check-in on 21 Nov 2023."
"Practices & Processes
Currently, the tribe has a reduced set of established or documented core practices and processes, or those that exist are largely informal and ad hoc.
There is incomplete documentation for management control over issues, risks, and tasks, this is captured at Tribe meetings
Formal guidelines for managing repositories have not been established.
Proposed Level: 1
(reasoning below)
The tribe will undergo a reorganization and is in the process of determining the most effective structure for its squads and processes. Until a definitive direction is established and the tribe begins to document its core practices and processes, we advise classifying this dimension at level 1.
Collaboration & Communication
A communication protocol is in place, but it remains informal and is primarily confined to the leadership of the tribe, with limited dissemination to all members of the tribe.
Squads have established communication channels, including specific Slack channels utilized by tribe members and open ‘office hours’ at squad level
Collaboration is not optimal, often happening only when issues arise.
Teams within the tribe tend to operate in silos, attendance at ‘office hours’ is positive, but there can be a a lack of awareness of others' activities.
There's an absence of structured methods for monitoring project progress, issues, or risks.
Decisions
taken in isolation are not consistently communicated to other members or teams.
There's a lack of clarity on roles, responsibilities, decision-making authority on large targeted outcomes
Proposed Level: 1
(reasoning below)
We propose assigning level 1 due to the presence of informal communication protocols, limited collaboration, isolated team operations, lack of structured project progress monitoring, and inadequate clarity on roles and decision-making authority within the tribe.
Vendor Integration
The roles and responsibilities for managing and integrating the vendor's contributions are not explicitly established.
There's a lack of a formal process for defining, tracking, and integrating the work done by the vendors.
The method for incorporating the external vendor's work into the tribe's work and repositories remains ambiguous or unrecorded.
Proposed Level:
1 (reasoning below)
We propose assigning level 1 due to the absence of formalized roles, responsibilities, and processes for managing and integrating the work of external vendors. Regular coordination meetings are in place, but they lack the support of a defined framework for effective vendor engagement and work integration.","How can the tribe improve collaboration, communication, and project progress monitoring to enhance overall effectiveness and efficiency, given the current informal practices and lack of formal guidelines?","To improve collaboration, communication, and project progress monitoring, the tribe can consider implementing the following strategies:

1. Establish a formal communication protocol: Develop a clear and comprehensive communication protocol that outlines the channels, frequency, and expectations for communication within the tribe. This protocol should be disseminated to all members of the tribe to ensure everyone is aware of how to communicate effectively.

2. Encourage cross-functional collaboration: To reduce siloed operations, the tribe can encourage cross-functional collaboration by establishing regular meetings between different teams and squads. This will help increase awareness of other teams' activities and promote a more collaborative working environment.

3. Implement structured project progress monitoring: To enhance project progress monitoring, the tribe can implement structured methods for tracking issues, risks, and tasks. This can be achieved by using project management tools and establishing regular check-ins to discuss project status and address any issues that arise.

4. Define roles and responsibilities: To clarify decision-making authority and roles within the tribe, it is essential to define and document roles and responsibilities for each team member. This will help ensure that decisions are made collectively and that everyone understands their responsibilities in achieving the tribe's goals.

5. Formalize vendor integration processes: To improve vendor integration, the tribe can establish formal roles and responsibilities for managing and integrating the work of external vendors. This can include defining a formal process for tracking and integrating vendor work, as well as establishing clear guidelines for incorporating external work into the tribe's repositories.

By implementing these strategies, the tribe can enhance collaboration, communication, and project progress monitoring, leading to improved overall effectiveness and efficiency."

1. Review the PI Plan review slides and PI Objectives smartsheet to identify the major risks and cross-team dependencies.
2. For each major risk, propose a method for monitoring its progress and impact. This could include:
* Regularly scheduled meetings or check-ins to discuss the risk and its potential impact.
* Implementing a risk tracking tool or dashboard to monitor the risk and its status.
* Assigning a risk owner who is responsible for tracking and mitigating the risk.
* Establishing triggers or thresholds that indicate when the risk has escalated and requires immediate attention.
3. For cross-team dependencies, propose a method for tracking and communicating their status. This could include:
* Regularly scheduled meetings or check-ins between the dependent teams to discuss progress and any issues.
* Implementing a dependency tracking tool or dashboard to monitor the status of dependencies and their impact on the overall project.
* Assigning a dependency owner who is responsible for tracking and managing the dependency.
* Establishing clear communication channels and protocols for reporting and addressing any issues or delays related to dependencies.

By following these steps, we can effectively monitor the major risks and cross-team dependencies outlined in the PI Plan review slides and PI Objectives smartsheet, and ensure that we are achieving specific, measurable, achievable, and realistic goals within our PI's shorter term iterations."

This will help the program to deliver value to the business and meet regulatory requirements.

In terms of production targets, the key first top features that need to be populated are likely to be related to the business value and ecosystem assessment, as well as the IO regulatory/decentralization assessment. These features will need to be prioritized based on their potential impact on the business and the program's ability to meet regulatory requirements.

For UAT readiness, the top features that are ready should be identified and tested to ensure that they meet the program's quality standards and are fit for purpose. This will help to minimize the risk of defects and issues being discovered later in the development process, which could delay the program's delivery.

However, there are potential risks associated with these objectives. For example, there may be challenges in identifying and prioritizing the top features for production, particularly if there are competing demands or limited resources. There may also be risks related to UAT readiness, such as issues with the testing environment or difficulties in recruiting and managing UAT participants.

To mitigate these risks, it will be important to gather program risks from every squad and present them during Program Risk meetings. This will help to ensure that potential issues are identified and addressed early on, and that the program is able to deliver value to the business in a timely and efficient manner.

In addition to the risks, there are also potential benefits associated with these objectives. For example, by prioritizing the top features for production and ensuring that they are UAT-ready, the program will be able to deliver value to the business more quickly and efficiently. This will help to improve the program's reputation and credibility, and may lead to increased support and investment from stakeholders.

Overall, the specific objectives for Vitor Silva in the 2nd Planning Event are to ensure that the top features for production are identified and prioritized, and that they are ready for UAT by the end of the event. While there are potential risks associated with these objectives, there are also potential benefits, and by managing risks effectively and delivering value to the business, the program can help to ensure its success."

Smaller team planning sections rather than company wide so all 700 people need to intersect at the same time
Proposal: It's not something we can action immediately because of standards; however a static website to present plan instead of boring stock slides.","How should the Head of Department, Leonard Hegarty, communicate the correct slide template to the team, and what is the proposal for presenting the plan instead of using stock slides?","The Head of Department, Leonard Hegarty, should communicate the correct slide template to the team by ensuring that the template is clearly defined and shared with all team members upfront. This can be done through a team meeting or via email, making sure that everyone has access to the template and understands how to use it.

        As for the proposal for presenting the plan instead of using stock slides, the suggestion is to create a static website to present the plan. This approach would provide a more engaging and interactive way to share the plan with the team, rather than relying on traditional stock slides. The website could include various sections, such as an overview of the plan, team planning sections, and a clear definition of 'done' to ensure a level of completion. This would allow for a more streamlined and efficient planning process, without requiring all 700 team members to intersect at the same time."

Subject to executive approval and agreement with the affected teams/individuals","Considering the proposed options seeking executive approval, what is the potential impact on current work and relationships from engaging external vendors like Tweag and QuViQ for CIP-1694 Ledger Features, Consensus Integration, and Agda Typechecking?","The potential impact on current work and relationships from engaging external vendors like Tweag and QuViQ for CIP-1694 Ledger Features, Consensus Integration, and Agda Typechecking are as follows:

        For CIP-1694 Ledger Features, engaging Tweag may provide value to the team as a contributing member with up to 3 person months effort requested. However, there is a potential impact statement from Tweag(NC) being reviewed, and the assessment is ongoing. On the other hand, engaging Heinrich Apfelmus from Cardano Foundation may cause possible harm to the CF relationship.

        For Consensus Integration, engaging Tweag may provide experienced support in case issues arise with consensus mechanisms/integration with up to 1.2 person months effort requested. However, there is a potential delay to Genesis contract completion.

        For Agda Typechecking, engaging QuViQ may not have any potential impact as they have an existing contract assignment for this task.

        Therefore, engaging external vendors like Tweag and QuViQ for CIP-1694 Ledger Features, Consensus Integration, and Agda Typechecking may have potential impacts on current work and relationships, and it is essential to consider these impacts before making a decision."

The next check-ins are 8/2 for Plutus v3 integration and Hardfork enactment, and 13 Feb 2024 for v3 build in 8.8. Guardrails for governance are being handled with potential budgetary and community implications by IOG and CF building a version of Guardrails script in PI1, with legal not wanting to give guardrails to the community. A compromise has been made to release the GR doc without reference to the 'Constitution', and Charles wants the interim constitution to be implemented by the community."

comments added during/after Core Tech Leadership call","What are the key refinement items and next check-ins for the Chang-HF priorities in PI1, and how do they relate to the collaboration with CF on development and testing?","The key refinement items for the Chang-HF priorities in PI1 include the potential removal of rules in the Ledger to an intra-era Hardfork (HF-E), and the implementation of Guardrails for Governance by IOG and CF. The next check-ins for these items are on February 23, 2024. The collaboration with CF on development and testing involves increasing CF involvement in the Chang-HF, and discussing potential 'midnight' asks from Chang and BLS. The proposed 'drop' for Midnight includes the exchange, Swap, redeem onto Midnight, possibly 'mid-2025' or early, and fast settlement may not be met by Peras, so guarantees are expected. The roadmap for Midnight needs to be defined, and technical discussions with Node, CTO, and others are ongoing. The correct interaction with INTERSECT regarding CIP-109/full node P2P also needs to be established. The full node P2P will affect Daedalus, and Blockfrost, Ogmios, Scroll, and others need to confirm they are good to go with p2p setup. A security audit update is planned, and a design audit and code audit (Bcryptic) will be conducted. A possible full external audit of the node is also being considered. The Cardano Mainnet scalability is a new topic, and Laos Tiered Pricing is an HF item for handling more throughput in the future. Parameter changes with the INTERSECT Parameter Committee are also planned."

The node version 8.1.2 has been released and the change freeze is now in place, with only patches allowed upon agreement into environments. The 8.7.x version is suitable for HAL and is on-track, with a wallet upgrade for Conway. The 8.8 version is due and will include Plutus v3 integration.

The Ledger code has been implemented and audited, with minor fixes from the audit being worked on. The Trezor code has been implemented and is with the Trezor team for review. CIP-95 has been integrated with barebone UI support, with a new UI targeted. The protocol is up-to-date, with Prod Params, and the wallet Yoroi is being worked on. Software wallets such as Lace, Yoroi, NuFi, Eternl, Flint, and Gero are in progress, with some on-track. The serialization library has been published with full Conway support, with no material update to CDDL. SanchoNet is expected to be released in 8.7.x, with a DApp able to act as a DRep and constitutional guardrails script. The CC scripts will be released publicly by the end of March, with plutus-script, aiken at CF, and input from participants, review, and testing of the script. P2P pre-Genesis will enable post-signed documents, with relay updates and paperwork. Exchanges running Rosetta 8.x will get a Rosetta update, with 8.9 being the final p2p release. Daedalus will support 3-30k, with SPOs stopping connecting to IOG relays. The relay decommissioning will monitor the load on relays, with a Daedalus upgrade to point to P2P and a wallet upgrade to 8.9 to allow Daedalus to join the p2p relay network. The Cardano Explorer BETA is expected to go live in March '24. The Cardano-addresses have been moved to the INTERSECT and are used by Core Tech(IOG) and HAL teams, with a plan to remove some of the haskell logic from cardano-addresses into cardano-api in Q1-24.

Work on Plutus v3 integration has commenced and is expected to be completed by mid-January. The hardfork enactment work is also targeted for January '24. Additionally, the 8.8 Sanchonet release, which includes DApp support as a DRep and constitutional guardrails script, is planned for 21/2 with the bootstrap phase. The ogmios release is also planned for the same time. The CC scripts, including the release of guardrails publicly, are planned for the end of March or earlier. The P2P pre-Genesis/CF will enable post signed document and relay update paperwork is also in progress. The relay decommissioning of 105 relays is being monitored for load. The wallet upgrade to 8.9 will allow Daedalus to join the p2p relay network. The Cardano Explorer BETA is planned for March '24. The release freeze is in place with no mainnet until Q1 '24, and may tag pre-releases with no re-spin. The plan for Chang is to remove some of the haskell logic from cardano-addresses into cardano-api in Q1-24."

Notes
None","How will IOI handle and communicate the resolution of issues in collaboration with Intersect, from triage to potential hot-fix deployment and incident reporting, according to the described process?","IOI will handle and communicate the resolution of issues in collaboration with Intersect through a process that begins with Intersect contacting IOI via a nominated channel. IOI's engineers on duty will then triage the issues, with additional engineers called in as necessary to further evaluate the issues. Community members may also be called in to assist with issue evaluation and testing. 

        Fixes will be developed, tested, and deployed according to the severity of the issues, with other work items potentially down-prioritized. If necessary, hot-fixes will be deployed. Intersect will be kept informed of the state of play throughout the process. 

        Communications teams may be mobilized where necessary to deal with the wider community. Finally, an incident report may be produced and published in accordance with responsible disclosure procedures agreed with the OSPO, if necessary. Best practices and additional links are not provided in the context."
"Purpose
Provide an outline Change Management Process for the Cardano Continuity contract managed by Intersect and IOI.  This gives certainty over how changes can be introduced.  This procedure does not apply to the regular PI planning cycles, which agree scope and effort for an upcoming 3-month period.  It applies to any changes that are made to adjust direction, scope and effort between those periods, or to changes that are made to policies and procedures that affect delivery under the Continuity work plan.
Procedure
The change management process proposes 4 different procedures:
Request for change review: Change coordinators use this procedure when handling change requests.
Change planning:
Change coordinators and specialists employ this process to prepare the implementation plans for changes.
Change approval:
The change manager and approvers (e.g., customer representatives and service owners) follow this procedure to approve planned changes.
Change implementation:
Specialists use this process to implement infrastructure changes.
Change closure:
Specialists follow this procedure when they perform production tests after changes have been implemented, and change coordinators employ it when they close out changes.
Change requests
.  These are typically managed in different ways:
Scheduled changes
are changes to a service or system at a particular time that affects uptime or functionality
Routine changes
are changes that maintain ‘as is’ functionality and do not impact uptime
Emergency changes
are reactive changes with limited time to resolve or avoid incidents that have serious business impact
Change Management roles
change requestor
recognises and identifies the need for change. The change requestor completes the change form and submits it for review. The requestor is responsible for answering any queries related to the change, ensuring the change is implemented when planned, and reporting the status of the change after implementation.
change manager
is responsible for managing change procedures, receiving and prioritising change requests, evaluating the risk level associated with requests, and keeping thorough records of the outcome of each change.
change advisory board
is responsible for authorising changes and further evaluating requests when the change manager determines that there is a high risk associated with these requests. The board takes into account the impact that a requested change may have on all affected parties. When these high-risk changes are brought to the attention of the change advisory board, the board will schedule a meeting with a detailed agenda to determine how to proceed.
The
approver
decides whether to approve or reject changes.
The
implementer
is responsible for implementing the change
Process Outline
Either party may initiate a change request outside the usual PI planning process
Changes may be to scope of work, allocated effort, or both
Changes must be raised via the joint delivery assurance meeting and agreed in writing by both parties.  A permanent record in email or other electronic will be considered to constitute a written agreement
Where a change involves increased effort or reallocation of effort that requires new staff to be onboarded by IOI, additional charges may apply
Conversely, where a change involves overall reduced effort by IOI below the agreed level, a pro-rata reduction in charges may apply
Changes will be considered to be part of the Continuity contract and subject to its terms and conditions
Changes may incur costs over and above the actual work that is done, reflecting disruption to teams, the need to reallocate effort, onboard new staff etc.  Intersect will be informed of any such impacts prior to the change being agreed
Changed scope will be monitored in the same way as normal work items and reports provided in the usual form
Level 3 support issues may reduce agreed scope or effort on other agreed work items.  The impacts of this support will be estimated and notified to Intersect.  No penalties will apply in this case
In emergency (e.g. an urgent security issue), IOI will commence work immediately to resolve the issue and notify Intersect as quickly as possible.  This may also reduce agreed scope or effort on other agreed work items.  Again, no penalties will apply
Where necessary, the IOI roadmap will be updated to account for changes.  It may also be updated to account for new long-term work items. While every effort will be made to comply with the roadmap when planning work, the roadmap necessarily represents targets/goals rather than planned work.  Roadmap items must be picked up from the roadmap via the regular planning process.
Risks will be evaluated following each change, and the risk register updated
Changes to policies and procedures will also be accommodated.  Where these have no material impact on the cost of delivery, there will will no additional charge.  Additional charges may apply where significant additional effort must be deployed, or a reduction in scope/effort may be required

Notes
Subject to legal review and agreement by both IOI and Intersect","How are changes to the Cardano Continuity contract managed by Intersect and IOI, including the roles and procedures for requesting, planning, approving, implementing, and closing changes, as well as the potential costs and impacts associated with those changes?","Changes to the Cardano Continuity contract managed by Intersect and IOI are managed through a Change Management Process that outlines four different procedures: Request for Change Review, Change Planning, Change Approval, and Change Implementation. The Change Management roles include the Change Requestor, Change Manager, Change Advisory Board, Approver, and Implementer.

Request for Change Review: Change coordinators use this procedure when handling change requests.

Change Planning: Change coordinators and specialists employ this process to prepare the implementation plans for changes.

Change Approval: The Change Manager and approvers (e.g., customer representatives and service owners) follow this procedure to approve planned changes.

Change Implementation: Specialists use this process to implement infrastructure changes.

Change Closure: Specialists follow this procedure when they perform production tests after changes have been implemented, and change coordinators employ it when they close out changes.

Change requests can be of three types: Scheduled changes, Routine changes, and Emergency changes. Scheduled changes are changes to a service or system at a particular time that affects uptime or functionality. Routine changes are changes that maintain ‘as is’ functionality and do not impact uptime. Emergency changes are reactive changes with limited time to resolve or avoid incidents that have serious business impact.

The Change Requestor recognizes and identifies the need for change. The change requestor completes the change form and submits it for review. The requestor is responsible for answering any queries related to the change, ensuring the change is implemented when planned, and reporting the status of the change after implementation.

The board takes into account the impact that a requested change may have on all affected parties. When these high-risk changes are brought to the attention of the Change Advisory Board, the board will schedule a meeting with a detailed agenda to determine how to proceed.

The Approver decides whether to approve or reject changes.

The Implementer is responsible for implementing the change.

Changes may incur costs over and above the actual work that is done, reflecting disruption to teams, the need to reallocate effort, onboard new staff, etc. Intersect will be informed of any such impacts prior to the change being agreed.

Where necessary, the IOI roadmap will be updated to account for changes. While every effort will be made to comply with the roadmap when planning work, the roadmap necessarily represents targets/goals rather than planned work. Roadmap items must be picked up from the roadmap via the regular planning process.

Changes to policies and procedures will also be accommodated. Where these have no material impact on the cost of delivery, there will be no additional charge. Additional charges may apply where significant additional effort must be deployed, or a reduction in scope/effort may be required."

        1. Identity Management for CC, needed for Chang-HF - Ultimate Owner: Samuel Leathers (Budgetary for example)
        2. User Stories for Chang - Ultimate Owner: Mike Ward
        3. Detailed Test needed for detailed testing of CIP-1694 - Ultimate Owner: Samuel Leathers
        4. Chang-HF priorities in PI1 - Ultimate Owner: Samuel Leathers
        5. Guardrails for Governance - IOG and CF will build a version of Guardrails script in PI1 - Ultimate Owner: Kevin Hammond
        6. Collaboration with CF on (dev and) testing - Increase CF involvement in Chang-HF - Ultimate Owner: Leonard Hegarty
        
        These action points are prioritized by activity and have an impact on the Chang-HF priorities in PI1.

1. Review the PI Plan review slides and PI Objectives smartsheet to identify the major risks and cross-team dependencies.
2. For each major risk, propose a method for monitoring its progress and impact. This could include:
* Regularly scheduled check-ins with the team or individual responsible for addressing the risk.
* Implementing a risk tracking system or dashboard that provides real-time visibility into the status of each risk.
* Setting up automated alerts or notifications for when a risk reaches a certain threshold or milestone.
3. For cross-team dependencies, propose a method for tracking and communicating their status. This could include:
* Establishing a regular cadence for cross-team communication and collaboration, such as a weekly or bi-weekly meeting.
* Creating a shared document or platform where teams can update the status of their dependencies and see the status of others.
* Implementing a dependency tracking system or dashboard that provides real-time visibility into the status of each dependency.
4. Ensure that the methods for monitoring risks and dependencies are specific, measurable, achievable, and realistic. This means setting clear goals and metrics for tracking progress, and ensuring that the methods are feasible given the team's resources and constraints.
5. Continuously monitor and adjust the methods as needed to ensure they are effectively addressing the risks and dependencies. This could include making changes to the frequency or format of check-ins, updating the risk tracking system, or adjusting the communication cadence for cross-team dependencies.

By following these steps, we can effectively monitor the major risks and cross-team dependencies outlined in the PI Plan review slides and PI Objectives smartsheet, and ensure that we are achieving specific, measurable, achievable, and realistic goals within our PI's shorter term iterations."

(Achievable) The team will work with the relevant stakeholders to acquire the necessary resources. (Realistic) The team has identified the necessary resources and will work to acquire them. (Time-bound) The risk must be monitored throughout the PI.
2. Risk 2: (Specific) The team may encounter unexpected technical issues that could delay the achievement of the objectives. (Measurable) This will be measured by the number and severity of technical issues. (Achievable) The team will work to identify and address technical issues as they arise. (Realistic) The team has identified potential technical issues and will work to address them. (Time-bound) The risk must be monitored throughout the PI.
3. Risk 3: (Specific) The team may not be able to meet the time-bound objectives due to unforeseen circumstances. (Measurable) This will be measured by the progress towards the objectives. (Achievable) The team will work to identify and address any issues that could delay the achievement of the objectives. (Realistic) The team has identified potential delays and will work to address them. (Time-bound) The risk must be monitored throughout the PI.

The cross-team dependencies are:

1. Dependency 1: The team depends on the infrastructure team to provide the necessary hardware and software to achieve the objectives.
2. Dependency 2: The team depends on the database team to provide the necessary database support to achieve the objectives.
3. Dependency 3: The team depends on the security team to provide the necessary security support to achieve the objectives.
4. Dependency 4: The team depends on the network team to provide the necessary network support to achieve the objectives.
5. Dependency 5: The team depends on the application team to provide the necessary application support to achieve the objectives.

The team will monitor these dependencies throughout the PI and work closely with the relevant teams to ensure that they are addressed in a timely manner."

Smaller team planning sections rather than company wide so all 700 people need to intersect at the same time
Proposal: It's not something we can action immediately because of standards; however a static website to present plan instead of boring stock slides.","How should the Head of Department, Leonard Hegarty, communicate the correct slide template to the team, and what is the proposal for presenting the plan instead of using stock slides?","The Head of Department, Leonard Hegarty, should communicate the correct slide template to the team by ensuring that the template is clearly defined and shared with all team members upfront. This can be done through a team meeting or via email, making sure that everyone has access to the template and understands how to use it.

        As for the proposal for presenting the plan instead of using stock slides, the suggestion is to create a static website to present the plan. This approach would provide a more engaging and interactive way to share the plan with the team, rather than relying on traditional stock slides. The website could include various sections, such as an overview of the plan, team planning sections, and a clear definition of 'done' to ensure a level of completion. This would allow for a more focused and efficient planning process, without requiring all 700 team members to intersect at the same time."

Alexey Kuleshevich","What are the current status and risks associated with the implementation of CIP-1694's external interfaces, specifically the Node CLI, as of July 6, 2023?","The current status of the Node CLI for CIP-1694 is that it is in progress for several functions, including creating governance actions, creating a Constitution Update governance action, creating votes on governance actions, modifying the BUILD-RAW command, and modifying the BUILD command. Stubs with supporting workshop narratives are available for some of these functions. The likelihood of the demo scope being limited due to time availability and integration unknowns is medium to high, with the impact being that some functions may have to be demonstrated using a prepared earlier approach. The mitigation for this risk is to ensure that there is enough time available for the demo and to address any integration unknowns as they arise. The team working on this implementation includes Carlos Lopez de Lara, Kevin Hammond, Samuel Leathers, Gerard Moroney, and Billy Mullins."

Subject to executive approval and agreement with the affected teams/individuals","Considering the proposed options seeking executive approval, what is the potential impact on current work and relationships from engaging external vendors like Tweag and QuViQ for CIP-1694 Ledger Features, Consensus Integration, and Agda Typechecking?","The potential impact on current work and relationships from engaging external vendors like Tweag and QuViQ for CIP-1694 Ledger Features, Consensus Integration, and Agda Typechecking are as follows:

        For CIP-1694 Ledger Features, engaging Tweag may provide value to the team as a contributing member with up to 3 person months effort requested. However, there is a potential impact statement from Tweag(NC) being reviewed, and the assessment is ongoing. On the other hand, engaging Heinrich Apfelmus from Cardano Foundation may cause possible harm to the CF Relationship.

        For Consensus Integration, engaging Tweag may provide experienced support in case issues arise with consensus mechanisms/integration, with up to 1.2 person months effort requested. However, there is a potential delay to Genesis contract completion.

        For Agda Typechecking, engaging QuViQ may not have any potential impact as they are already under contract assignment. However, the potential impact on current work and relationships is not explicitly stated in the context.

        Therefore, engaging external vendors like Tweag and QuViQ for CIP-1694 Ledger Features, Consensus Integration, and Agda Typechecking may have potential impacts on current work and relationships, and it is essential to consider these impacts before making a decision."

comments added during/after Core Tech Leadership call","What are the key priorities and next check-ins for the Chang-HF and Plutus v3 integration in PI1, and how are guardrails for governance being handled with potential concerns from the legal team and the community?","The key priorities and next check-ins for the Chang-HF and Plutus v3 integration in PI1 are Plutus v3 build in 8.8 on 13 Feb 2024, and v3 integration and Hardfork enactment. Guardrails for governance are being handled by IOG and CF building a version of Guardrails script in PI1, but there is a concern from the legal team about releasing Guardrails to the community, as they don't want to give guardrails to the community. A compromise has been suggested to release the GR doc without referring to the 'Constitution'. Charles wants the interim constitution to be implemented by the community. The next check-in for Guardrails is 08 Feb 2024."

comments added during/after Core Tech Leadership call","What are the key refinement items and next check-ins for the Chang-HF priorities in PI1, and how do they relate to the collaboration with CF on development and testing?","The key refinement items for the Chang-HF priorities in PI1 include the potential removal of rules in the Ledger to an intra-era Hardfork (HF-E), and the implementation of Guardrails for Governance by IOG and CF. The next check-ins for these items are on February 23, 2024. The collaboration with CF on development and testing involves increasing CF involvement in the Chang-HF, and discussing potential 'midnight' asks and requirements with CF. The Ledger team will implement, test, and then enact the Hardfork, while the CLI team will backfill and cover any new hires or departures. The Security audit update will be discussed with Kevin, and an external review will be initiated by INTERSECT after the Hardfork. The Cardano Mainnet scalability is a new topic, and Laos Tiered Pricing is an HF item for handling more throughput in the future.

x5 fold increase of users
Interact with LSM go-live, load and memory,
delegation adds to delegation map
LSM library will address UTxO issue, other parts of ledger state to disk would solve this problem/
→ Dec '24 for x1 delivery,
Refactor Consensus for in-memory for LSM, integrate LSM library/
→ deployment process similar to p2p/
(gradual rollout, LSM would require better hardware)
→ breakglass, LMDB solution, increase in users, … UTxO problem with LMDB, 5 new wallets , …

comments added during/after Core Tech Leadership call",What is the current status and next check-in date for the Plutus v3 integration and Hardfork enactment as part of the Chang-HF priorities in PI4?,"The current status of the Plutus v3 integration and Hardfork enactment as part of the Chang-HF priorities in PI4 is that it is almost complete, with PR and merges ongoing. The source built version is ok, but there is an issue with 'prebuilt' versions, which has a workaround. The release page and deploying on different platforms is also being worked on. The target check-in date for this task is 5th January 2024."

Cardano-addresses whilst having been moved to the INTERSECT is used by Core Tech(IOG) and HAL teams (CF), the proposal of forking this and CF working on the related items for wallets is workable, the plan for Chang is to remove some of the haskell logic from cardano-addresses into cardano-api in Q1-24","What is the current version and expected release schedule for the node, Daedalus, and Plutus, and how do they relate to the integration of SanchoNet and the implementation of CIP-95?","The current version of the node is 8.7.2, with an expected release of 8.8 in the near future. This release will include Plutus v3 integration. Following 8.8, the next release will be 8.9, which will include Daedalus and P2P on the mainnet, as well as Plutus v3. The node version 8.7.x is currently suitable for HAL. The expected release schedule for SanchoNet is 8.7.x, with a wallet upgrade for Conway currently in progress and on track. The node version 8.8 is due and will include Plutus v3 integration. The node version 8.7.2 is suitable for HAL. The Trezor code has been implemented and is currently with the Trezor team for review. The Ledger code has been implemented and audited, with the team now working on minor fixes from the audit. CIP-95 has been integrated and barebone UI support for CIP-95 is in progress, with a new UI targeted. The software wallets Yoroi, Lace, and NuFi are currently in progress, with Eternl, Flint, and Gero on track. The serialisation library has been published under CDDL, with no significant updates. The SanchoNet constitutional committee, parameter change, treasury withdrawal, and revised constitution are all informational. Plutus v3 integration work has commenced, with progress to completion by mid-January. The hardfork enactment work is targeted for January '24. The governance tool is live, with Lace integration expected in 8.8 Sanchonet. The DApp can act as a DRep, with constitutional guardrails script in 8.8. The ogmios release is expected by the end of March. The CC scripts will be released publicly by the end of March, with plutus-script, aiken at CF via the Community. The input from 'participants' is needed for review and testing of the script. The P2P pre-Genesis/CF will enable post signed document, with relay update paperwork and exchanges running Rosetta 8.x. The 8.7.3* will integrate against the backend, with 8.9 being the final P2P release. The Daedalus support of 3-30k, SPOs to stop connecting to IOG relays, relay decomm 105 relays, and wallet upgrade to 8.9 to allow Daedalus to join p2p relay network are all in progress.

Work on Plutus v3 integration has commenced and is expected to be completed by mid-January. The hardfork enactment work is also targeted for January '24. Additionally, the 8.8 Sanchonet release, which includes Plutus v3 integration, is expected to be released in Q1-24, along with the GovTool live and Lace integration. The Cardano Explorer BETA is also planned to go live in March '24. The release freeze for mainnet is in place until Q1 '24, with only patches allowed upon agreement into environments.

Purpose
Outline how IOI will respond to issues raised and how resolutions could be agreed between Intersect and IOI
Process Guide
Intersect contacts IOI via nominated channel
Engineers on duty triage issues
Additional engineers are called in as necessary to further evaluate issues
Community members will be called in to assist with issue evaluation and testing
Fixes are developed, tested and deployed according to severity.  Other work items may be down-prioritised
Where necessary, hot-fixes will be deployed
Intersect will be fully informed of the state of play
Communications teams will be mobilised where necessary to deal with the wider community
Where necessary, an incident report will be produced and published in accordance with responsible disclosure procedures agreed with the OSPO

Notes
None","How will IOI handle and communicate the resolution of issues in collaboration with Intersect, from triage to potential hot-fix deployment and incident reporting, according to the described process?","IOI will handle and communicate the resolution of issues in collaboration with Intersect through the following process:

        1. Intersect contacts IOI via a nominated channel to report an issue.
        2. Engineers on duty at IOI will triage the issue to determine its severity and the resources required to evaluate and resolve it.
        3. If necessary, additional engineers will be called in to assist with the evaluation of the issue.
        4. Community members may also be called in to assist with issue evaluation and testing.
        5. Fixes for the issue will be developed, tested, and deployed according to its severity. Other work items may be down-prioritized as necessary to address the issue.
        6. If the issue is critical, a hot-fix may be deployed to address it as quickly as possible.
        7. Intersect will be kept informed of the state of play throughout the resolution process.
        8. If necessary, communications teams will be mobilized to deal with the wider community.
        9. Once the issue has been resolved, an incident report may be produced and published in accordance with responsible disclosure procedures agreed with the OSPO.

This process ensures that issues are handled efficiently and effectively, with clear communication between IOI and Intersect throughout the resolution process. It also allows for the involvement of community members and additional engineers as needed, and provides for the possibility of hot-fixes and incident reporting where appropriate."
"Purpose
Provide an outline Change Management Process for the Cardano Continuity contract managed by Intersect and IOI.  This gives certainty over how changes can be introduced.  This procedure does not apply to the regular PI planning cycles, which agree scope and effort for an upcoming 3-month period.  It applies to any changes that are made to adjust direction, scope and effort between those periods, or to changes that are made to policies and procedures that affect delivery under the Continuity work plan.
Procedure
The change management process proposes 4 different procedures:
Request for change review: Change coordinators use this procedure when handling change requests.
Change planning:
Change coordinators and specialists employ this process to prepare the implementation plans for changes.
Change approval:
The change manager and approvers (e.g., customer representatives and service owners) follow this procedure to approve planned changes.
Change implementation:
Specialists use this process to implement infrastructure changes.
Change closure:
Specialists follow this procedure when they perform production tests after changes have been implemented, and change coordinators employ it when they close out changes.
Change requests
.  These are typically managed in different ways:
Scheduled changes
are changes to a service or system at a particular time that affects uptime or functionality
Routine changes
are changes that maintain ‘as is’ functionality and do not impact uptime
Emergency changes
are reactive changes with limited time to resolve or avoid incidents that have serious business impact
Change Management roles
change requestor
recognises and identifies the need for change. The change requestor completes the change form and submits it for review. The requestor is responsible for answering any queries related to the change, ensuring the change is implemented when planned, and reporting the status of the change after implementation.
change manager
is responsible for managing change procedures, receiving and prioritising change requests, evaluating the risk level associated with requests, and keeping thorough records of the outcome of each change.
change advisory board
is responsible for authorising changes and further evaluating requests when the change manager determines that there is a high risk associated with these requests. The board takes into account the impact that a requested change may have on all affected parties. When these high-risk changes are brought to the attention of the change advisory board, the board will schedule a meeting with a detailed agenda to determine how to proceed.
The
approver
decides whether to approve or reject changes.
The
implementer
is responsible for implementing the change
Process Outline
Either party may initiate a change request outside the usual PI planning process
Changes may be to scope of work, allocated effort, or both
Changes must be raised via the joint delivery assurance meeting and agreed in writing by both parties.  A permanent record in email or other electronic will be considered to constitute a written agreement
Where a change involves increased effort or reallocation of effort that requires new staff to be onboarded by IOI, additional charges may apply
Conversely, where a change involves overall reduced effort by IOI below the agreed level, a pro-rata reduction in charges may apply
Changes will be considered to be part of the Continuity contract and subject to its terms and conditions
Changes may incur costs over and above the actual work that is done, reflecting disruption to teams, the need to reallocate effort, onboard new staff etc.  Intersect will be informed of any such impacts prior to the change being agreed
Changed scope will be monitored in the same way as normal work items and reports provided in the usual form
Level 3 support issues may reduce agreed scope or effort on other agreed work items.  The impacts of this support will be estimated and notified to Intersect.  No penalties will apply in this case
In emergency (e.g. an urgent security issue), IOI will commence work immediately to resolve the issue and notify Intersect as quickly as possible.  This may also reduce agreed scope or effort on other agreed work items.  Again, no penalties will apply
Where necessary, the IOI roadmap will be updated to account for changes.  It may also be updated to account for new long-term work items. While every effort will be made to comply with the roadmap when planning work, the roadmap necessarily represents targets/goals rather than planned work.  Roadmap items must be picked up from the roadmap via the regular planning process.
Risks will be evaluated following each change, and the risk register updated
Changes to policies and procedures will also be accommodated.  Where these have no material impact on the cost of delivery, there will will no additional charge.  Additional charges may apply where significant additional effort must be deployed, or a reduction in scope/effort may be required

Notes
Subject to legal review and agreement by both IOI and Intersect","How are changes to the Cardano Continuity contract managed by Intersect and IOI, including the roles and procedures for initiating, planning, approving, implementing, and closing changes, as well as the potential costs and impacts associated with those changes?","Changes to the Cardano Continuity contract managed by Intersect and IOI are managed through a Change Management Process that outlines four different procedures: Request for Change Review, Change Planning, Change Approval, and Change Implementation. Change Closure is also a part of the process, which involves performing production tests after changes have been implemented and closing out changes.

Change requests can be of three types: Scheduled Changes, Routine Changes, and Emergency Changes. Scheduled Changes are changes to a service or system at a particular time that affects uptime or functionality, while Routine Changes maintain 'as is' functionality and do not impact uptime. Emergency Changes are reactive changes with limited time to resolve or avoid incidents that have serious business impact.

The Change Management roles include the Change Requestor, Change Manager, Change Advisory Board, Approver, and Implementer. The Change Requestor recognizes and identifies the need for change, completes the change form, and submits it for review. The Change Manager is responsible for managing change procedures, receiving and prioritizing change requests, evaluating the risk level associated with requests, and keeping thorough records of the outcome of each change. The Change Advisory Board is responsible for authorizing changes and further evaluating requests when the Change Manager determines that there is a high risk associated with these requests. The Approver decides whether to approve or reject changes, and the Implementer is responsible for implementing the change.

Either party may initiate a change request outside the usual PI planning process. Changes may be to the scope of work, allocated effort, or both. Changes must be raised via the joint delivery assurance meeting and agreed in writing by both parties. Where a change involves increased effort or reallocation of effort that requires new staff to be onboarded by IOI, additional charges may apply. Changes will be considered to be part of the Continuity contract and subject to its terms and conditions. Changes may incur costs over and above the actual work that is done, reflecting disruption to teams, the need to reallocate effort, onboard new staff, etc. Intersect will be informed of any such impacts prior to the change being agreed. Changed scope will be monitored in the same way as normal work items and reports provided in the usual form. Level 3 support issues may reduce agreed scope or effort on other agreed work items. In emergency situations, IOI will commence work immediately to resolve the issue and notify Intersect as quickly as possible. This may also reduce agreed scope or effort on other agreed work items. No penalties will apply in either case.

Where necessary, the IOI roadmap will be updated to account for changes. Risks will be evaluated following each change, and the risk register updated. Changes to policies and procedures will also be accommodated. Where these have no material impact on the cost of delivery, there will be no additional charge. Additional charges may apply where significant additional effort must be deployed, or a reduction in scope/effort may be required."

Testing on Sanchonet is planned to begin after its completion. The Plutus v3 integration is related to the Genesis hardfork, which is planned to occur in January '24. Additionally, relay decommissioning is also planned, with 105 relays being monitored for load. The plan is for SPOs to stop connecting to IOG relays and for Daedalus to upgrade to point to the P2P network. Wallets will also need to be upgraded to allow Daedalus to join the P2P relay network. The Cardano Explorer BETA is planned to go live in March '24. The release freeze for mainnet is in place until Q1 '24, with pre-releases being tagged for testing. The plan for Chang is to remove some of the haskell logic from cardano-addresses into cardano-api in Q1-24."
,In the context of,"Context:
        The 2016 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXXI Olympiad, are a major international multi-sport event that is currently being held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. Over 11,000 athletes from 206 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) are participating. The Games are the first to be held in South America, and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.

        Question: In the context of, what are the Games of the XXXI Olympiad?

How does it scale?
What’s going to give? (Scope, budget, Time, Quality)
Obstacles & Bad habits
What does it take?
Not List (What is it not)","Considering the context, what key factors define the success of building Catalyst Voices and how can we ensure its scalability while maintaining quality and addressing potential obstacles and bad habits?","The success of building Catalyst Voices is defined by several key factors. Firstly, the platform must effectively engage and empower its target audience, providing them with the tools and resources they need to amplify their voices and drive change. This can be achieved by ensuring the platform is user-friendly, accessible, and tailored to the needs of the community.

        Secondly, the platform must facilitate meaningful connections and collaborations between its users, enabling them to build a strong and supportive network. This can be achieved by incorporating features such as forums, messaging, and collaboration tools, and by fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect.

        Thirdly, the platform must be scalable and sustainable, with the ability to grow and adapt to the changing needs of the community. This can be achieved by building the platform on a robust and flexible technology stack, and by implementing a sustainable business model that ensures the long-term viability of the platform.

        To ensure the scalability of Catalyst Voices while maintaining quality, it is essential to prioritize and focus on the most critical features and functionalities, and to implement rigorous testing and quality assurance processes. Additionally, it is important to establish clear performance metrics and benchmarks, and to regularly monitor and analyze the platform's usage and engagement data to identify areas for improvement.

        Potential obstacles and bad habits that may hinder the success of Catalyst Voices include a lack of user engagement, technical issues and bugs, and a lack of resources or funding. To address these challenges, it is important to have a clear and well-defined roadmap for the platform's development, and to establish strong partnerships and collaborations with relevant organizations and stakeholders.

        In summary, the success of building Catalyst Voices is defined by its ability to effectively engage and empower its target audience, facilitate meaningful connections and collaborations, and be scalable and sustainable. To ensure its scalability while maintaining quality, it is essential to prioritize and focus on the most critical features, implement rigorous testing and quality assurance processes, and establish clear performance metrics and benchmarks. Additionally, it is important to address potential obstacles and bad habits by having a clear roadmap and establishing strong partnerships and collaborations."

Typo’s included
Innovation Appstore & Business Logic
The wealth is in the network. Instead of building a one-shot application, we are building conversational app infrastructure and we start simple by making our proposal template actionable over time. By thinking in an Catalyst Innovation Appstore (CIA ;), We slowly teach people (First internally, later externally) that they can choose their innovation-models of their choice. We are in the data-shaping and energy-channeling business, as value is organised data, or Data-management systems, but I don’t like the word management, as it might imply static data.
Actionable Content
//description needed
Archetypes
There are three main archetypes that can be found in any domain.
Perfect Joe/Jane - This person knows what he/she wants, knows what is needed, and knows how to get it done. You should not bother these people too much which fluff, give them the tools and let them get to work. They will figure it out.
Deliver my Vision - This person has a clear vision, but still wants guidance how to get from A to B. Supporting this person with great tips and tricks, and a streamlined workflow will set this person up for success.
Inspire Me - This person does really know what it wants, but it does like to get inspired with content / ideas & proposals when they see them. Often this triggers actions in the person to take the next steps.
Other popular archetype systems are personality wheels, brand archetypes, and personality tests.
Ability Tracks
Removing limiting beliefs through self-connection is one of our ability track missions. This involves a lot of unlearning/relearning and self-development. This all starts with self-awareness which some people have by nature, and others need to develop. Being able to stay in the moment is perquisite training before all else. Design Principle: Nudge people into meaningful action through intrinsic motivation and storytelling.
Action/Activity Tracker
Instead of nudging, action tracks just highlight things Perfect Joe's / Janes did. They can set objectives if they want to, but it's more of an activity tracker that  might set Badges if people want too.
Catalyst CLI
Catalyst Command Line Interface is an idea to make our system powered by a command line. This allows us to experiment and test (requirement from Discovery 2022) and create a system that’s highly flexible and tailors to meaningful actions from the start. // This concept just arose so needs more thinking, but is a well known approach for system development. // Not eat your own dogfood, but design the system with the system is the direction of the thinking here.
Conversational Apps
A conversational app is a selection of conversational scripts that use story-structures and data-structures over time to shape data/ideas/concepts from Spark to Winning proposal. An example of a data-structure is the F11 Proposal template. Yet this misses before, during, after thinking like Setup, Effort, Rewards / Follow up actions.
// Conversational Interaction Design / Make Information Actionable course needed.
Data flow & Data Types
All data is equal, but some data is more equal than others. (Animal Farm, by George Orwell adaptation.)
If we want to move towards distributed decision-making systems we need to bring data to their respectful owners. Physically moving data between peers is a challenge but also opens up a plethora of opportunities. A data-type is meta-data attached to data, that uses an (inverse)hashtag system.
Think those old tube systems in banks, that used air pressure to move money around in the building. Often from the workfloor to the high security top-level.
Flow / Success Formula
Intent x Purpose x Meaning
Individual, Shared, Collective.
// needs description
Spaces
Every space, which is nothing more than a data-container or directory has it's own narrative. This narrative must be compelling and give people a feel of responsibly and impact. We are solving real world problems, and that's not for everybody. The biggest obstacle people face is their limiting beliefs which are powered by news/propaganda.
Privacy by Design
By Ann X. & Katina M.  // Get notes ASU.
Blockchain from a social perspective
Blockchain is the collective memory we miss in our daily lives. As human's biggest obstacle is that we forget, but the emotions events create stress in our bodies. (Think C19 and induced trauma.) Language turns emotions in actions, Emotions are energy in motion. We can design on top of chain (real world assets) or we can design with language over time/epochs/blockspace. The different impact of both approaches need to be discussed, as social system design focuses on the positive impact in people’s daily lives and works back towards the systems we need to achieve that.
Brands, Space, Pools, Containers & Crates
All effort is encrypted by default (Privacy by design) and people can choose to add team-members to their pools/projects. Pool consists of data-containers, data-containers contain crates.
Pool: Individual Private
Nobody can see the data that is in this pool.
Pool: Private Team
All effort is encrypted by default (Privacy by design) and people can choose to add team-members to their pools/projects.
Pool: Public
When teams decide they want a time-boxed round of feedback, they can change the state of project to public (total), or they can select specific segments they flag for incentives (comments / reviews / collaboration request / ???)
Pool: Permissioned
Rethinking how we use data in decentralized systems is key.
Pools contain Containers contain Projects/Proposal in crates.
By adding entities/people to pools or specific projects people can control access. Changing data does not work like in real time systems, we add specific tasks to sub-segments of a proposal. So we introduce system like ping-pong, and please review x within 12 hours.
(This needs more thinking). Our brain is not fit for information overload so thinking in Tides & Waves might be a good angle (biomimicry)
Design with Data-structures over time/epoch/blockspace.
Cardano uses 5 day epochs. This is a great way to guide and time-box incentives.
Thinking is blocks of 5 days gives us the opportunity to 'plan' incentives in the future, as we know that at some point in the future an epoch # will come around.","""How can the concept of 'Ability Tracks' and 'Action/Activity Tracker' be utilized to nudge individuals towards meaningful actions and remove limiting beliefs through self-connection and intrinsic motivation?""","The concept of 'Ability Tracks' and 'Action/Activity Tracker' can be utilized to nudge individuals towards meaningful actions and remove limiting beliefs through self-connection and intrinsic motivation by first identifying the individual's archetype and their specific needs and goals. For the 'Perfect Joe/Jane' archetype, the system can provide them with the tools and resources they need to achieve their goals without much guidance. For the 'Deliver my Vision' archetype, the system can offer streamlined workflows and tips and tricks to help them reach their desired outcome. And for the 'Inspire Me' archetype, the system can provide them with inspiring content and ideas to trigger actions and motivate them to take the next steps.

        The 'Action/Activity Tracker' can then be used to highlight the actions and activities that the individual has taken, allowing them to see their progress and stay motivated. This can also help to remove limiting beliefs by showing the individual that they are capable of taking meaningful actions and achieving their goals.

        Additionally, the 'Ability Tracks' can focus on removing limiting beliefs through self-connection and intrinsic motivation by providing resources and activities that help the individual develop self-awareness and stay present in the moment. The system can nudge individuals towards meaningful actions by using design principles such as intrinsic motivation and storytelling to make the content and activities more engaging and relevant to the individual's goals and needs.

        Overall, the combination of 'Ability Tracks' and 'Action/Activity Tracker' can help individuals to take meaningful actions, remove limiting beliefs, and achieve their goals through self-connection and intrinsic motivation."

"Catalyst - People Powered Innovation.
Keeping people, not machines, at the center of decision-making. (Value driver for the Catalyst Brand?)
By creating an decentralized collaborative workspace (Notion & Loop are centralized workspaces), we enable people to do their best work supported an by a best-practices innovation Appstore (1 simplified method to get started). By bringing continuous grading to Design challenges, Meaningful Projects & Traction Objectives we move from quantity to quality, and from work to impact (meaningful work).
By bringing quality projects and other investors to a Funding Tracks Space we turn challenges/projects into funded Dream teams with plans.
And by creating an ADA economy space we capture best-practises that others can pick up to create viral loops. (repeat)

Firstly, by creating a decentralized workspace, the Catalyst brand enables people to work collaboratively and make decisions together, rather than relying on centralized authorities or machines. This is in contrast to centralized workspaces such as Notion and Loop, which may not provide the same level of autonomy and decision-making power to individual users.

Secondly, the Catalyst brand's use of continuous grading in design challenges, meaningful projects, and traction objectives helps to ensure that the work being done is of high quality and has a meaningful impact. This focus on quality over quantity helps to ensure that people's work is valued and that they are able to make a meaningful contribution to the projects they are involved in.

Thirdly, the Catalyst brand's creation of a funding tracks space allows people to bring quality projects and other investors together to form funded dream teams with plans. This helps to ensure that people's ideas and work are supported and given the resources they need to succeed, further emphasizing the brand's commitment to keeping people at the center of decision-making.

Finally, the Catalyst brand's creation of an ADA economy space helps to capture best practices and create viral loops, allowing others to learn from and build upon the work of others. This collaborative approach to knowledge sharing and innovation helps to ensure that people are able to learn from and build upon each other's work, further emphasizing the brand's commitment to keeping people at the center of decision-making."

5. Strong community support: Flutter has a large and active community of developers, which means that Hermes and Athena can easily find help and resources when needed. This is important for ensuring the success of their Catalyst app.
6. Integration with existing tools and platforms: Flutter can be easily integrated with existing tools and platforms, such as Firebase, making it a versatile option for Hermes and Athena.

Overall, Flutter's cross-platform compatibility, fast development, high performance, customizable UI, strong community support, and integration with existing tools and platforms make it a suitable option for Hermes and Athena to build cross-platform applications for Catalyst."
"A Dataconomy has different traits. Here I want to describe what the difference in thinking is.
Web2
Web3
Interaction design in pages.
Interaction design in conversational scripts (that can be loaded in pages (loose), or use more transitional UI approach ‘Chat Made Actionable’ interfacing down the line (strict). Hybrid can work as well.
Network Thinking has data-containers moving between Nodes/Spaces. The containers get enriched with significant and non-significant data-structures, that unlock abilities.
UX STORYLINE EXAMPLE
USE CASE
An example for an individual posting a proposal (let’s keep things simple for starters)
A proposer is finished with working through the proposal template (Data-structure), and used the proposal segment anchors to easily navigate through the proposal template sections. (Design Principle: No back and forth mania in Voices!)
The proposer changes the state of the proposal (data-container) to ‘Ready to publish to funding track’, and the system (assistant) asks if the proposer want to do a pre-flight check. The proposer select resume this later. And the Assistants responds, cool, I will add this to your Inventory to pick up.
The inventory get a little red dot 1, this might happen after disconnect of the user, not to create addictive behaviors.
As the proposer has other business to attend to the proposer locks his environment and goes about his/her business.
An example of a simple conversational scripts. (Screenplay writing if you will), that bring our real and virtual worlds closer together.
--
After the ‘Pre-flight check’ might be good to using Publishing Jargon?
The Proposal (data-container) goes to the Grants Space.
- People sort, select, and cast their votes.
Niels Note:
Will detail this story over time as there need to be a lot more detail, but to get an impression this is ok.
Potential Script extension post MVP:
On Tally result ‘Funded’ a data-structure 'Proposal-Funded / Proposal-Not-Funded / Proposal Approved / …' is added to the Proposal (data-container), and a first Milestone Budget NFT is awarded. (I believe first payment always goes through?) This gives the ‘winner’ the ability to request funds from treasury and disperse funds at his/her discretion. And is part of decentralized thinking. Don’t do important actions on behave of someone else. (like putting money into a wallet address, without noticing because most wallets have no fund received notification features)
Lived Experience:
I lost hundreds of dollars because I didn’t notice funds where already paid, and ADA was in a terrible downfall. So having the option to extracts funds when I wanted would have been amazing. (But also needs to have a pressure limit)","How does the concept of a ""Proposal-Funded"" data-structure in a Web3 Dataconomy enable decentralized thinking and potentially prevent loss of funds?","The concept of a ""Proposal-Funded"" data-structure in a Web3 Dataconomy enables decentralized thinking by allowing the 'winner' of a proposal to request funds from the treasury and disperse funds at his/her discretion. This empowers the winner to control their own funds, rather than having someone else perform important actions on their behalf. This can prevent loss of funds, as seen in the lived experience where funds were lost due to not noticing that they had already been paid and the value of ADA was in a downfall. By having the option to extract funds when desired, the winner can avoid such losses."
"Context
The need for a versatile and efficient framework to develop applications across multiple platforms (Web, iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, and Windows) led us to consider various options like Kotlin Multiplatform and React Native. Flutter emerged as the most promising solution due to its wide-ranging platform support, single codebase feature, and robust widget library.
Assumptions
We need to build scalable, robust, and maintainable systems.
With capabilities that extend efficiently to web, desktop, and mobile platforms.
React Native cannot build for Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux from one code base.
A great React Native app requires Swift/Objective-C/iOS and Kotlin/Java /Android engineering. A code base with 5 languages.
Facebook has moved on from using React Native
Facebook (that developed and maintained React Native) also cited technical limitations as a reason for its decision to pull out including performance issues and difficulties with maintaining a consistent codebase across different platforms.
Flutter’s easy learning curve means the development team can learn and adapt to Flutter and Dart for cross-platform development, offering redundancy within the team.
The performance and compatibility of Flutter-built applications are adequate across all targeted platforms.
Libraries that are used by other IO tribes, such as JS used by React apps like Lace, can be shared and used by Flutter developers.
Technology evaluation
Flutter, developed by Google, has several compelling arguments for use as our primary technology for cross-platform app development:
One Codebase
: With
Flutter
, we write one codebase for Web, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. This saves significant development time and effort. You also have a consistent and uniform app across all platforms, which enhances the user experience and reduces the likelihood of platform-specific bugs.
Dart language
: Flutter uses the
Dart language
. Dart is easy to understand for JavaScript, Swift, or Java developers. Dart supports object-oriented and functional concepts, making it easy for developers to use and providing a good structure for application development.
Learning Curve:
Dart is generally considered easy to learn if you come from a background in JavaScript, Swift, Java, or any other modern programming language
Performance
: Flutter apps are compiled into native code, which gives them near-native performance. They don't rely on intermediate languages or interpreters, which can significantly impact an app's speed and performance.
Rich and customizable widgets
: The Flutter framework provides a rich set of beautifully crafted widgets that can be customized to suit our brand's look and feel for a unique and professional appearance.
StackOverflow trends,
reports
support the above, Flutter as a top technology, desirable skill to hold today because:
Flutter is platform agnostic
Flutter simplifies and speeds application development
Flutter is easy to learn and easy to use (+ has excellent documentation)
Flutter scales well
Hot Reload:
This feature significantly increases developer productivity by enabling changes to be reflected instantly without requiring the app to restart. It's an excellent feature for UI development and testing new features.
Less Testing:
Because Voices app will be built from a single codebase, the quality assurance process will become more straightforward and quicker. This is because we only need to write automated tests once for both platforms. Moreover, a single codebase reduces the chances of platform-specific bugs.
Excellent Documentation:
Flutter has an extensive range of documentation and tutorials available, which is an invaluable resource for our development team. Google and the Flutter community have made concerted efforts to make starting with Flutter as seamless as possible. This also makes the onboarding process for new team members more manageable.
Faster Time to Market:
With a single codebase, robust widgets, and a simple testing process, development time can be drastically reduced. This allows for a faster time to market, which allows us to demonstrate value quicker.
Growing Community and Support:
Flutter is backed by Google, which provides a certain level of confidence and security. The community around Flutter is rapidly growing, with increasing libraries and resources available to solve various everyday tasks and issues.
Integration with Firebase
: Flutter supports Firebase, Google's mobile development platform. Firebase provides many features, such as analytics, databases, messaging, and crash reporting, that can be easily incorporated into a Flutter app.
Code Push
:
Code pushes for mobile apps can significantly reduce the time and effort involved in deploying updates, allowing for faster iteration and responsiveness to user feedback.
Remote Widgets
: Mechanism for rendering widgets based on declarative UI descriptions that can be obtained at runtime.
Over 30 teams at Google use Flutter
:
Resourcing
In March 2024, Catalyst began interviewing for Senior Flutter engineer roles with more than 50 candidates currently being screened by the Talent team after only 48 hours of advertising.
For short-term needs we are engaging
Scalac, Sotatek, or Proxify vendor
resources ($25-$55 ph) to  begin work on Voices in April while hiring in the right skills. For comparison Palo-IT vendor quoted Catalyst $800 per day per Flutter engineer.  Alongside Flutter resources, vendors are also being engaged to increase QA capacity in the team.
Risks
Potential complications in accessing some native features and hardware-specific functionalities on each platform. Mitigated by the team’s willingness to explore documentation and find technical answers (see Flutter Resources below)
Additional testing across different platforms is needed to ensure consistency and performance. Mitigated by early planning and best estimations of additional QA tasks and resourcing.
Flutter's desktop and web support is less mature than its mobile support, which might lead to unforeseen challenges. Catalyst Voices MVP is for desktop only so the mobile support risk is hopefully mitigated by time and community growth and know how for Flutter platform.
Consequences
Streamlined development process with a unified codebase, reducing development and maintenance costs.
Increased ability to rapidly deploy updates and new features across all platforms simultaneously.
Dependency on a single technology stack may pose challenges if Flutter does not evolve as expected.
Cross-tribe reusability
Integrating External Libraries with Catalyst Voices
In cases where our Flutter projects need to leverage functionality from external JavaScript, Swift, or other libraries—developed by different teams within or outside our organization—we will create Flutter (Dart) packages that serve as bridges to these libraries. This approach enables us to maintain the benefits of Flutter's cross-platform capabilities while utilizing these external libraries' strengths and unique features.
Example:
We use
js
binding to bridge to wallets that are chrome plugins.  We would not want to use it for much more.
And heres an example however not everything we do is
js
:
https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-components/cardano-serialization-lib/
This is used almost uniformly by developers to serialise transactions.  Built in rust, it runs in the browser as WASM so
js
can use it, and so can flutter.

"Why does decentralization matter for Catalyst?
Most crypto projects are like a man with a hammer when it comes to decentralization - everything looks like a nail. Rather than seeking to solve a problem with decentralization, they take it as a given that more decentralization is better. This can be a costly mistake, since decentralized software is more complex and difficult to build compared to centralized alternatives. Furthermore, most ""decentralized"" applications retain one or more single points of failure, rendering those costly investments in decentralization useless.
We make the case that decentralization is a mission critical objective for Catalyst because it:
Reduces regulatory risk for
IOG
by removing fiduciary responsibility in the fundraising process. We do not custody funds, we simply manage software that allows users to custody funds in a permissionless way
Unlocks new untapped markets by removing the constraints faced by fund custodians,
such as KYC, that prevent existing fundraising services from operating in 90% [TODO: get actual figure] of the world
How do Hermes, Athena, and Catalyst Voices fit together to realize a vision for decentralized fundraising?
The decision to invest in this product portfolio directly supports the objectives outlined above.
Hermes provides an engine for building, distributing, and running applications with fully decentralized backends - not merely consuming distributed data sources as part of larger centralized system as most ""Dapps"" do today. A successful proof-of-concept has already demonstrated how the Hermes architecture might run an application backend that relies only on distributed data sources. The MVP for this project will demonstrate how that architecture can be used to support a voting app with a fully distributed backend, that is capable of supporting privacy-preserving encrypted ballots, which can be used in Catalyst.
This vision for Hermes is significant for several reasons:
Novel Catalyst application for voting
Cross-chain utility
Reusable components
First, it offers a novel voting application for transparent and verifiable decision-making that is unmatched in the current competitive landscape. Although blockchain-based voting solutions like
Cardano Ballot, SundaeSwap Governance,
and others exist, none of them have fully decentralized application backends, and
none of them support encrypted ballots for voter privacy
. Similar limitations may apply to technology internal to IOG such as Hydra and Partnerchains. Initial discovery into Hydra use cases can be found
here
.
Second, it opens
opportunities for cross-chain applications
that can serve to attract developers and users to the Cardano ecosystem, even if they have invested significant financial resource on other blockchains.
Finally, the Hermes MVP will have several capabilities that are immediately reusable to developers inside and outside IOG, like decentralized registration tracking and voting power calculation that can be configured to new use cases.
Athena serves as the frontend companion to the Hermes MVP. It will explore how we might build, deploy, and deliver a fully decentralized application UX, that can be run locally on user machines using the Hermes client, creating the possibility for fully decentralized application experiences that are safe, secure, and censorship-resistant. In our analysis, UX will be the final frontier in building decentralized applications, and we intend to position ourselves as leaders and trailblazers on that frontier.
Upon delivery of the MVP for both Hermes and Athena, Catalyst will have the means to run voting events that are
actually
decentralized, on both the front and the backend. If Catalyst voting can be run on fully distributed infrastructure shared with the community, this may not only significantly reduce operating costs for Catalyst by utilizing community compute and storage resources, but also reduce regulatory risk by positioning IOG as a participant in the process rather than a centralized administrator. At this point, further investments may be made to realize all capabilities required by the end-to-end fundraising process in a fully decentralized way.
Catalyst Voices serves as a pipeline to realize this vision of a fully decentralized fundraising platform. It will be built from the ground up to be ""decentralize-able"", though it will remain centralized through its first iterations. This will allow us to advance the state of the art of fundraising, without being constrained by the complex architecture required for full decentralization.
First, we will focus on defining the critical business logic required by various parts of the fundraising process in a centralized way. After validating and hardening that business logic through Catalyst funding rounds, we will translate the same logic into Hermes modules that can be run in distributed fashion. If we can validate the efficacy of those modules through rigorous proof of concept testing on the Catalyst testnet, then we will promote them to production to serve as the backend to the Voices platform. In this way, Catalyst Voices will evolve over time to use fewer and fewer centralized backend services, until it is capable of being run using only decentralized data sources. In this mature state, we will continue to maintain a centrally hosted of version of the Voices UX, but users will have the choice of interacting through that central point OR participating using only their local Hermes node.
But where is the money?
To this point, we have emphasized the cost savings and risk reduction offered by these development initiatives. However, what we find most exciting is the potential to unlock new, expansive, and scalable revenue generating opportunities in the fundraising space.
Today, Catalyst relies solely on community-approved grant funding to generate revenue. This is great to support operation in the short term, but our ambition is to deliver a revenue-generating product that can sustain itself over time, regardless of Cardano community sentiment. Some of starting points for the revenue-generation potential of Catalyst are detailed
here
and include:
Pay-to-play: users pay fees to participate: membership, per-submission
Investor Reports/ Product Discovery Data: publication to publish startup intelligence to customers
Grantmaking Software: provide Saas
Innovation fund Service Provider: Provide a managed service for other ecosystems
Fundraising / Crowdfunding Platform: Donations / match funding, taking a fee per tx
Advertising & Sponsorship: promoting partners in key real estate (e.g
projectcatalyst.io
and reports)
Catalyst has begun to explore expanding our capabilities as a fundraising engine to compete with fundraising platforms like Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, and Patreon. These platforms generate billions of dollars on fees taken from peer to peer transactions, and we are well positioned to compete due to:
Existing community of innovators and participants seeking to raise funds, earn rewards/incentives, as well as backers eager to support their favorite projects, allowing us to jump-start the creation of a two-sided marketplace
Reduced transaction processing fees compared to incumbents, allowing us to undercut their prices and win price-sensitive customers
Novel features like conditional fundraising unlocked by technology like smart contracts, allowing us to radically differentiate ourselves from current offerings
Fewer regulatory constraints due to decentralization, allowing us to access global markets untouched by incumbent competitors
The revenue potential of this play is explored in greater detail
here
.
These ideas and other promising avenues of revenue generation are to be explored and sharpened during the upcoming leadership meeting to take place February '24 in Longmont, CO.","How does the decentralization of Catalyst's fundraising process through the use of Hermes, Athena, and Catalyst Voices contribute to reducing regulatory risk for IOG and unlocking new markets, while also providing a novel voting application and cross-chain utility?","The decentralization of Catalyst's fundraising process through the use of Hermes, Athena, and Catalyst Voices contributes to reducing regulatory risk for IOG by removing fiduciary responsibility in the fundraising process. This is achieved by not custodizing funds, but instead managing software that allows users to custody funds in a permissionless way. Decentralization also unlocks new untapped markets by removing the constraints faced by fund custodians, such as KYC, that prevent existing fundraising services from operating in 90% of the world.
        Hermes provides an engine for building, distributing, and running applications with fully decentralized backends, which is significant because it offers a novel voting application for transparent and verifiable decision-making that is unmatched in the current competitive landscape. Additionally, it opens opportunities for cross-chain applications that can serve to attract developers and users to the Cardano ecosystem, even if they have invested significant financial resources on other blockchains.

Deweaponise language.","How can Web3 technologies, such as micropayments and subscriptions from the blockchain, contribute to the development of genuine interest and two-way communication within Web3 communities, while also promoting the deweaponization of language?","Web3 technologies, such as micropayments and subscriptions from the blockchain, can contribute to the development of genuine interest and two-way communication within Web3 communities in several ways.

Firstly, by enabling micropayments, Web3 technologies allow users to monetize their content and engage in value-for-value exchanges with their audience. This creates a more equitable and sustainable ecosystem for content creation and consumption, where creators are incentivized to produce high-quality and engaging content, and users are motivated to actively participate and contribute to the community.

Secondly, by offering subscriptions from the blockchain, Web3 technologies enable users to own and manage their digital assets and relationships in a decentralized and trustless manner. This empowers users to take control of their online presence and identity, and fosters a sense of ownership and belonging within the community.

Moreover, by promoting the deweaponization of language, Web3 technologies can help to create a more inclusive and respectful environment for communication and collaboration. By discouraging the use of aggressive, divisive, or discriminatory language, Web3 technologies can encourage users to engage in constructive and empathetic dialogue, and to listen and learn from each other's perspectives and experiences.

Overall, by leveraging the power of micropayments and subscriptions from the blockchain, Web3 technologies can facilitate genuine interest, two-way communication, and deweaponized language within Web3 communities, and contribute to the creation of a more open, fair, and collaborative digital world."

"This page is being prepared as pre-work to inform a deeper discussion in Longmont, CO, with leadership team about future direction of Catalyst, and alignment with IOG business priorities.
Catalyst has managed to generate revenue from delivery-based service contracts with the Cardano community, in the form of treasury grants. This helps to produce profitability at c.30% margin, that can be widened by investing in operating cost reduction.
An ambition is to build revenue-generating products that provide sustainable, scalable revenue, in addition to renewed service contracts fund over fund.
This page explores several options and their trade-offs. Note that these different strategies are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and we might align on a strategy that combines elements of more than one.

Governance Systems Feature Comparison
Q4 2022
Views from IOG Director of Architecture
Note from Benjamin Beckmann (Dir. Architecture):
Catalyst - Hermes & Athena
The Catalyst application is an exemplar that requires both Web3 and Web2 capabilities to deliver our community solution. For example, the Catalyst application must observe on-chain registration and calculate the registrant’s voting power from Cardano observations. In addition, Catalyst must allow an operator to publish fund details and topics, collect proposals, and facilitate review, voting, award, and monitoring of fund performers. These capabilities are specific to the needs of Catalyst as it is embodied Today.
In addition, minor modifications, such as observing registration and calculating voting power from another chain or storing fund and proposal data in a decentralized data store, can be added simply because the initial design abstracts details using a configurable framework of services per application.
In addition to extending the Catalyst application to other chain ecosystems, the framework can also empower the development of other applications. This framework consists of two main sections: the execution engine named Hermes and the Hermes Application which is named Athena for Catalyst.
Hermes provides standard services that a Web3 application requires, such as event processing when an observed chain produces a block or coordinating a pub/sub interaction with another Hermes node participating in the same application.
An application written on top of Hermes is called an hermes application.  For example, the coming implementation of Catalyst is an Hermes application called Athena. The Athena application comprises WASM business logic that consumes the underlying Hermes services through a common set of easy-to-understand interfaces. Therefore, the Athena application can easily interact with a blockchain by observing events and submitting transactions. In addition, an Athena application can provide users with an experience powered by WASM, a compilation target for many modern languages, including Rust, TypeScript, Scala, and many others.
The combination of Hermes and Athena has a direct application to the development of the Catalyst application, however it can also be applied to other applications as well. Two notable applications are replacing the Substrate GPLv3 licensed execution engine and a super node. The Hermes framework will provide an upgraded version of an execution engine for WASM simply by leveraging the newly delivered capabilities of WASM. In addition, it uses the same foundational libraries (libp2p and IPFS) which are common in many other decentralized applications. The Hermes engine can also observe and transact with other chains, and an accompanying Hermes application like Athena can implement the business logic required to facilitate the interaction needed to deliver a super node.
Current Catalyst features
Below is a set of core technical features that Catalyst operates to set up, run, and conclude a voting event campaign. Please note, that the below list doesn’t account for any steps or features that take place in Catalyst
Launch
of Infrastructure and voting event orchestration
Registration
: users register their voting power by connecting their Cardano wallet to the Catalyst voting app via QR connection or registration via CLI
Ideation
: managed by Ideascale, 3rd party SaaS platform used for proposal submission and community review stages
Snapshot
: fetch voting power given a connected wallet, freeze voting power based on stake distribution on mainnet, the custom definition of voting power based on transformation to raw token holdings
Voting
: Private voting via homomorphic ZKP, supports 1k votes per second, batch submission of votes, and voting power assigned based on staked ADA at a fixed point in time, preventing double spend/double voting.
Continuous publication
of the immutable voting log during the fund, verifiable by the community.
This is used to give the community assurance that no votes were not included, removed, or stuffed before the tally.
It was deployed for the first time in F10 and was very well received by the community.
Tally
: Tally completed by committee (n=1 today), verifiable by community
This builds on the features of (7) and allows the community to independently verify that the tally we publish matches the votes cast.
This feature was also deployed for the first time in F10 and was also very well received as a major technical improvement that gave better surety to the community about the integrity of the process and results.
Rewards distribution
: Calculate and distribute rewards on Cardano mainnet based on participation data
Experience has shown that the Catalyst Community wishes to see Project Catalyst progress as both a technical system and an operational fund.  Failure to deliver feature parity, at least to the extent observable by the community would risk being seen to be going backward and has a real risk of damaging the reputation of Project Catalyst.
There are ethical considerations at play when considering the trade-offs between voting in public or in private. For starters, millions of ada are at stake so coercion is one of the most important risks Catalyst aims to mitigate and preserve the integrity of the vote. To address this, Catalyst voters have benefited from protections afforded by ZKP encryption allowing them to vote without fear that their wallet balances and voting opinions public known to bad actors.  Private voting is a critical requirement as without it, the security, authenticity, and sovereignty of the individual is at risk.
Many of the features of Project Catalyst, both operational and technical serve security and integrity purposes which have been built up over the last 10 funds.  Reduction in feature parity will inevitably risk decreasing the security and integrity of the system and risks opening it to attack or obvious “gaming of the system”.
When we discuss changes to the system with the community we always need to include an explanation on how this improves the integrity or security of the system.  it would be very difficult to explain that the integrity or security has been compromised because of technical decisions that were made seemingly unilaterally within IOG or the Project Catalyst tribe.
Project Catalyst Architecture challenges
There are several technical and architectural challenges with the current project Catalyst stack, built around Jormungandr.
A summary of the technical and architectural challenges are:
Jormungandr is difficult to deploy and operate.
It requires a tightly controlled deployment to meet our throughput requirements, which prevents us from decentralizing the operation of the voting blockchain.
The rigid implementation of Jormungandr makes it difficult to add new vote types, to experiment with different voter groups and participation requirements, or use different voting power algorithms.
We can not have an event that has both private and public voting in the same event,  meaning delegated representation and liquid democracy cannot be realized, as envisioned, with the current stack.
Too many manual processes in the setup of the Jormungandr blockchain present opportunities for errors or potentially malicious behavior. We have automated some of these in the last six months, but getting all the data ready to run an event on Jormungandr is still long, complicated, and requires significant human effort.
Tallying results is manually triggered and all participants in the tally must be present and honest.
A dishonest participant can not produce an invalid tally, but they can prevent a tally from being conducted fully.
The treasury paper discussed M of N participants in Tally but the original implementation of the cryptographic voting in Jormungandr did not implement it.
Each blockchain is large (We budget 6GB/node) and stored in AWS at our cost.  This is in addition to all vote information databases and other fund data (milestone module data, payments data, etc).
We need to store this data redundantly on at least 4 nodes, and this translates directly to our cost base, as we are required to both operate all the nodes and also provide storage for them.
The estimated cost of a single fund from running Jormungandr alone is approximately USD 8,000.
Calculated at approx 480hrs of uptime during the voting and tally, for 4 machines, at approximately $4 per hour.
Cheaper machines are not an option, as extensive testing has shown that these are the cheapest machines available on AWS that provide the necessary performance characteristics required of Jormungandr to properly and reliably sustain the voting load of a Catalyst fund.
We have created an ad-hoc mechanism to allow for observability and auditability of the vote and tally, but it still requires Project Catalyst to periodically publish data for this purpose and can not be independently collected.
Starting points for evaluation
Catalyst processes have been designed as best as they can be within the limitations of the existing infrastructure, and any shift to an alternative needs to be considerate of the volume of transactions, data, and encrypted, private voting characteristics that Catalyst has implemented today.
Moreover, Catalyst voting is now operating at the scale of hundreds of thousands of votes being cast with privacy preservation over each 2-week voting period. This presents a problem for propagating a high throughput of votes to the Cardano blockchain without network congestion or poor UX. As the desired state is to fully verify that votes have been cast and received on-chain, this means that output for processing this volume of votes is either:
each vote is posted on-chain to Cardano, where privacy preservation is maintained.
This risks network congestion and a bad user experience.
It also requires an entire multi-gigabyte transaction load of votes for every fund to be carried by every full Cardano node in perpetuity even when the individual ballots cease to have meaning or value.
Voting on-chain also necessarily incurs a transaction cost, which could be significant as privacy-preserving encrypted votes are large (Several KB).  The cost of voting could dissuade participation.
eac
h vote is posted on-chain to Cardano, where privacy is compromised and voter choices and directions become public.
This risks our differentiation and reputational damage as Catalyst prides itself on being the first ZK voting application in the Cardano ecosystem
Public votes are smaller, but it still requires that every full Cardano node carries every vote in perpetuity even when the individual ballots cease to have meaning or value.
Smaller non-encrypted public votes would cost less from a transaction fee perspective to post to the blockchain, but they would still cost something. That could still disincentivize participation.
votes are rolled up so the voters' choices are both private and cost-efficiently posted on-chain.
Voters need a method to validate that their ballots have been included in the final tally, that the election was conducted with integrity, and that the results posted to the chain reflect the true result of the fund.
Voting off-chain is effectively free from a voters' perspective, and the individual ballots need only be stored in a decentralized manner while they are required for tally or audit purposes.  Once the result has been certified as valid, the individual ballots can be safely destroyed.
Key test for the ‘solution’
Does the solution allow for private voting at scale?
All registered voters (60k) voting on 1000 proposals across 10 separate vote plans (a vote plan is a category / challenge / funding track) over 2 weeks of voting
Metrics-driven testing for:
liveness (How responsive is the system under high distributed loads);
stability (how reliable is the system under high distributed loads); and
scaling (How fast is the system under high distributed loads).
Effects of more nodes added to the network
The assumption is that as nodes increase, network stability and performance are either maintained or demonstrably improved.
Challenges with existing CIPs and Catalyst voting
https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-36/
CIP-36 does not disambiguate between individual voters and dReps.
CIP-36 does not allow us to put different rules or conditions on dReps due to the fact we can not disambiguate them.
CIP-36 required GVC to maintain a centralized and IOG-controlled database of dReps to disambiguate them, which means there is no feasible way for the community to participate in that process, or contribute to it.  With CIP-36 all dReps would require to be registered with and vetted through IOG, including personally identifying information.
CIP-36 has no way to validate that a registration controls its voting key.
CIP-36 does not allow us to capture registrations for any other roles, such as Proposers, Tally committee, audit committee, proposal reviewers, etc.
https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0095
CIP-95 is related solely to voting on-chain for CIP-1694 actions.  It has no applicability to Project Catalyst outside of this.
I
t is NOT part of any current scope, but we could track CIP-1694 registrations in the Catalyst Voices app.  We could also track and detect requests from Project Catalyst to withdraw funds from the treasury for the next catalyst fund.  Participants in Catalyst could then be advised giving them a focused and informed opportunity to consent to the governance action to withdraw the funds for Catalyst or not.
Further,  being registered as a CIP-1694 style dRep could be a pre-requisite for registering as a Project Catalyst dRep, and even though the roles are distinct, they could be related to an individual registered stake address.  This could be additional information provided to voters to help inform their choices for dReps.
There may be other opportunities to use CIP-1694/CIP-95 functionality as a value add to Catalyst Voices, but it is not a feature required of the existing stack.
Active on-going collaboration.
Mithril/Hydra  (with comments from both Arnaud & Sebastian)
Hydra
- Provides isomorphic blockchain interfacing capabilities we can leverage in future version of
Hermes
.
Collaborating with their team on a common pub/sub protocol (with the  desire to utilize it in both mithril distribution and ).
“In 2023 Hydra, Catalyst, Research, and the CF collaborated on “Voting on Hydra” with the explicit goal of using that within future Catalyst architecture. This voting system has been used on mainnet during Cardano Summit to tally votes from users on ecosystem projects.”
Arnaud Bailly
NB: Details of the collaboration can be found here:
https://github.com/cardano-foundation/hydra-voting-poc
“Both, Mithril and Hydra, would be infrastructure which is made available through Hermes, very much the same way as the Cardano network is made available as a source.”
Sebastian Nagel
TxPipe Pallas Library - Mithril snapshot support.
The Hermes node will consume Mithril snapshots as one source of Cardano blockchain data.  This was enabled by earlier work performed by txpipe, and our contribution to the Pallas project has enhanced support for Mithril snapshots within the
Pallas Library
.
Sidechains/Partnerchains
Throughout the design of Hermes, we have been actively collaborating and information sharing with the Sidechains Tribe at an architectural level.
Midnight
Throughout the design of Hermes, we have been actively information sharing with the Midnight Tribe at an architectural level.
Voting on Hydra / Cardano Ballot
During 2023, the CF conducted a “voting on hydra POC” in collaboration with IOG.  Project Catalyst was involved closely with that work, as we were both providing consultation about the nature and characteristics of Project Catalyst that were attempting to be modeled and also evaluating the outcome for suitability with the Project Catalyst use case.
The POC successfully demonstrated a voting system running inside hydra heads, although it was far from feature parity with the Current catalyst system, and uncovered a number of technical challenges that would need to be resolved.
Voltaire Hydra Voting - From Federated to Decentralised [DRAFT]
Cardano Ballot is an evolution of the Voting on Hydra POC and the limitations observed in the POC remain in the current implementation of Cardano Ballot.
Notably:
Hydra head operators are required to commit a certain amount of ADA necessary to advance the hydra network state.  The service has high CPU and memory requirements.
All registered voters would need to have an NFT minted for them as part of their registration.  Hydra head operators would need to mint these NFTs for all voters.
There needs to be an NFT minted for every possible vote a voter could cast, as burning the NFT is what is used to prevent double voting.  As there is no voter registration and all stake address can vote, this would be a very large amount of NFTs to mint for an election the scale of catalyst.
Existing catalyst voter registration mechanics would not be applicable because the solution works with smart contracts which can not access metadata in registrations.
There are a number of avenues where the hydra-head operator can upset the election as outlined in the report.
No method is suggested for decentralizing or choosing head operators for an election.
There is no support for an independent audit of the voting on the heads.
There is no support at all for cryptographic voting and no easy way to add those features.  it is also unclear if there would be sufficient performance necessary to execute the required functions at the scale of a catalyst fund.
Anecdotally, it’s been told to the Catalyst team that Cardano Ballot prefers to vote into a database than a hydra head because of the limitations stated in the
report from CF
What is Hermes?
Hermes is an Engine for running Catalyst as a decentralized dApp frontend.
Hermes is a collection of generic Web-3 Libraries.  They are orchestrated in an Event-driven manner and provide imperative APIs.  This allows pluggable scripts implemented as WebAsm Components to implement application-specific logic and use a curated set of well-defined Web-3 APIs.
dApps do not need to concern themselves with how IPFS file storage or Pub/Sub works, or how blocks are synchronized from a blockchain.  These details are handled for the dApp which can focus on its specific business logic rather than solving common interfacing problems repeatedly.
For the MVP only the minimum subset of modules required by the Athena application will be implemented.  Further modules and APIs are planned, but they are all post-MVP, and they can be either implemented by the community as open-source contributions, by Project Catalyst to enable new functionality required by an extended Athena application or by another project within IOG if they wish to use the Engine.
Dividing the Web3 modules from the business logic makes it significantly easier for others to collaborate, and for contributions to be reviewed.  It also makes it easier to clearly distinguish between enabling modules and the applications underlying business logic.

What is a Hermes App?
A Hermes App is an archive of files that primarily consists of:
Metadata about the App
Its name
Who published it
Signatures proving who published it
A Collection of Static Files which are served by the Hermes Node as standard static web pages.
This allows a full UI/UX to be bundled with a Hermes App.
The App front end can be written in any language or tooling that targets browser-based apps. (React or Flutter for example)
It is no different from a standard Web2 application except that it DOES NOT get served from a centralized server but by the Hermes node itself.
This contrasts with every other system of which we are aware, that requires a Web2 server run by a centralized and trusted authority to host and serve the UI of the dApp at their cost.
A Collection of compiled Webasm modules that provide the equivalent of backend business logic to the front-end app served by the Hermes node.
The app can bundle any business logic it needs.
The front-end app interacts with the business logic the same as it would if it were a Web2 application, but the requests target the local Hermes node ONLY.
The WebASM modules have access to pre-integrated APIs that provide common re-usable Web3 components and data processing/storage libraries.  This simplifies the backend logic to simply process that data and execute the necessary business logic based on it.
As Hermes applications are bundled in an archive of files, the Hermes node itself can run any application that has been properly constructed.  This allows easy re-use of the Hermes Engine without over complexity that results from trying to orchestrate multiple independent services.  The difficulty in orchestrating multiple services is a key reason why end users are unable to successfully deploy dApps locally, and why most dApps do not even attempt local deployment.
This is not an exhaustive specification of the Hermes App architecture but it highlights the most important features relevant to this report.
What is Athena?
Athena is a Hermes App initially targeted to decentralize voting for Project Catalyst, designed to run on the Hernes engine.  For the MVP Athena will be targeted to ONLY provide a decentralized voting mechanism, which allows Project Catalyst to finally deliver on its promise of decentralized and auditable voting.
Athena implements a traditional Voting Bulletin board and does not attempt to store votes on a “block-chain” which is not a data structure that is historically suited to high volume transaction load.  Further, individual ballots can be large, especially if they are encrypted as in Project Catalyst.  An individual fund can have 1000’s of Proposals, and 1000’s of voters, which can lead to extremely high data storage requirements.  It's unusual in high-volume voting events (such as state-run elections) to retain individual ballots
(For example, UK legislation requires individual ballots to be archived only for 1 year and 1 day after an election, after which they are destroyed)
.
A blockchain is inherently immutable so all ballots would be stored immutable and forever, this would create a very large and mostly pointless resource load on any blockchain that attempts this at the scale of Project Catalyst.  Project Catalyst with Athena will adopt a Voting Bulletin board where the ballots are immutable and stored for the duration of the event, once the result is known and audited, then the individual ballots can be forgotten, there is no ongoing requirement to keep them once the outcome is validated through an open and auditable process.  Individual community members could elect to retain all individual ballots from an election but there is no operational requirement to do so.  The result of the election could then be immortalized on-chain as that data is very small by comparison to the entire set of ballots and also is the most important information from an election.
Athena will leverage this behavior to enable high-volume decentralized voting without being restricted to a slow blockchain for vote storage.
The design of Athena and its Voting bulletin board architecture is a result of:
Our own experiences with delivering 10 Catalyst Funds and operating the Project Catalyst infrastructure.
The experimentations Project Catalyst participated in with Voting on Hydra.
Input from IOG Research.
What Hermes and Athena are not?
Hermes is not a blockchain.
Hermes does include interfaces to blockchains (initially Cardano, but it's designed to interface to any desired blockchain).
The interfaces are made by pre-existing libraries, with thin wrappers to interface to the Event-driven model of Hermes.
Hermes is not a Pub/Sub networking protocol.
Hermes does include preexisting IPFS and LibP2P libraries to provide Node-to-node communication.
A thin layer interfaces these pre-existing libraries to a Hermes event-driven model.
Hermes provides common building blocks to make using Pub/Sub and Distributed hash tables easier from a dApp but does not include any specific Node to node protocol as they are provided by individual Hermes applications.
Hermes is not an incentivized node.
Unlike a blockchain where Nodes are required to secure the network, Hermes nodes are only required if the users of the nodes wish to use the features of a particular Hermes Application, and in our case Athena.
Individual Hermes applications may provide incentivization, such as Project Catalyst, which offers rewards to voters and other roles.  This is not because a user ran a Hermes node, it’s because they participated in Project Catalyst.
Individual users derive value from the functionality a Hermes Node and the Athena application provide them.  For example, no one is incentivized to run the current Catalyst Voting application on mobile, and yet thousands of people have downloaded and installed the app, solely because of the utility it provides them.
Athena is not a final implementation of project Catalyst.  It is an MVP implementation of decentralized voting only.  its purpose is to allow us to conduct further experiments, and iterate to add more and more decentralized functionality to project Catalyst.
Athena is not the only app that can run on a Hermes node.
Athena is just the dApp written by the Catalyst team to provide a decentralized Voting MVP upon which we can conduct further experiments regarding decentralizing and extending the capabilities of project Catalyst.
Example Research input from IOG Research
Key features of the Athena voting solution.
All participants (voters or observers) can observe in real-time the casting of votes.
Voter privacy is assured through advanced cryptography.
A number of nodes will act as redundant vote storage bulletin boards.
These are intended to be run by the community.
Similar to fully redundant disk storage, this system only requires a single faithful bulletin board to properly collect votes for the system to have integrity.
A decentralized UI usable through a local browser will allow the voter to see all proposals in a fund, check their voting power (independently of any central authority) and cast a vote.
Every node running the Athena application will be able to individually validate if the votes that are cast by a voter are valid.
The voting bulletin boards will not deliberately store multiple votes for the same proposals from the same voter.
Should that happen a very simple deconfliction will occur where the votes with the lowest hash will be used and all others conflicting ballots will be discarded.
It is impossible to forge a vote, so the only reason the ballots could be different is if a voter themselves is deliberately attempting to cast multiple conflicting ballots.
Deconflicting this way eliminates all possible reward for a voter attempting to do this.
Decentralized Tally is intended, but is NOT part of the MVP, which only attempts the voting portion of the Catalyst Fund.
if the MVP was used in a production setting the votes cast over it would be added to the votes received from the traditional system and the tally conducted as it is now, but with the union of all non-conflicting votes.
In this scenario, if a voter votes on both the legacy system and the MVP decentralized voting system, we would take the vote on the legacy system as the authoritative choice for the voter.
Why build an Engine and an App?
Many of the problems faced by Project Catalyst in meaningfully decentralizing the voting experience are common to other dApps.  In addition, Project Catalyst itself changes rapidly, fund on fund.  By dividing the project into an Engine and an Application that runs on it, we can:
Minimize or Eliminate redundant work for the large common requirements shared by dApps.
Improve division of labor between Application work and Common infrastructure work.
Improve the ability to iterate on the application and experiment with different interfaces.
Enhances re-use by the community of the Engine and the Application.
Allows us (or the community) to implement the Application in various languages while maintaining a common, well-tested, high-performance code.
Creates a well-defined event-driven paradigm that makes it easier to reason through and implement complex Web-3 systems without needing to understand the low-level details.
Why not deploy a Web 2 App like other dApps do?
Project Catalyst is currently deployed as a Web2-based dApp.  Web2 apps are:
Complex to deploy, which limits or excludes the community from using the systems we produce in any meaningful way.
They also tend to accumulate non-opensource components (such as deployment scripts) which further restrict the community's ability to develop with us.
Difficult for third parties in the community to contribute to the codebase because it's difficult to run the system.
Concentrates power into the hands of a single operator, which also concentrates risk.
Decentralized applications attempt to minimize or eliminate these concerns. Blockchains are decentralized, but if the dApps that interact with them are exclusively run by trusted centralized operators only then they suffer from all of the issues (both legislative and community) that traditional Web2 apps suffer from.
Hermes and Athena is a first step at truly decentralizing the apps that interact with blockchains.  It is built for the purposes of Project Catalyst but with full knowledge that this is an issue for the entire ecosystem and not just Project Catalyst.
Jormungandr was an attempt at decentralized voting, but it fails because it can not scale.  The further the nodes are from one another the slower the network gets, and it can not maintain the very high (and growing) loads required of Project Catalyst without being tightly controlled by a single operator.  Which defeats its purpose.
Collaborating post-MVP on Hermes Development
The intention with the Hermes engine is that is can be collaboratively developed.
For example, the Side chains / Partner chains tribe could add functionality to interface to Ethereum. This can be done as any standard open-source project would collaborate. For example, other Web3 grant providers such as SingularityNet’s Deep Funding programme, already have a wallet linking tool to allow both Ethereum and Cardano wallets to cast votes on proposals made to the Deep Funding program. Hermes would compliment and benefit from additional contributions.
The added subsystem would be available to dApps once integrated but would have no impact on any dApp that didn't use it.   This allows for the Hermes Engine itself to grow , evolve, and gain capabilities without unnecessarily breaking any existing dApp that can run on it.
Practically speaking, as soon as the core executor and Hermes application package are implemented and operational any contributor both internally and externally could meaningfully use the Hermes engine and collaborate on new features or Web3 interfaces.
The current plan according to the Roadmap for Hermes and Athena is that this level of functionality will be reached between the End of Milestone 2 and before the End of Milestone 3 - targeting Summer 2024.

The pull requests contained the necessary code changes to implement the wildcard patterns in both projects. Additionally, Arissara created a third pull request that combined the changes from the first two pull requests, ensuring that the wildcard implementation worked consistently in both catalyst-voices and Hermes. This was done by cleaning up the code and making sure that the wildcard implementation was functioning properly in both projects. The third pull request also included updates to the ast go lib, which was used in both projects, further ensuring consistency in the implementation."
"While all fresh in our minds and before vote begins - please capture entire process of app stores deployment comprehensively step by step and use a form of a checklist requirements on this page. So that anyone outside of us can understand what steps have to be taken and best practices along. Including who manages/owns which part (access, etc) so we understand flows but also back ups, and what not to miss based on the lessons learned. This effort, once done well - takes extra in the start but then we just keep it fresh.

"Hermes Executive Summary
The Hermes engine offers a novel architecture framework for developing and running web3 applications. It is a collection of generic Web-3 Libraries that are orchestrated in an Event-driven manner and provide imperative APIs. It allows pluggable scrips implemented as WebAsm components to implement application-specific logic and use a curated set of well-defined Web-3 APIs, offering a high degree of of customization and reusability.
Development of the MVP is being paid for by grants awarded via community approval in Catalyst Fund10, and will be constrained to the needs of a Catalyst voting Dapp (Athena). The MVP will consist of both Catalyst-specific and general purpose modules , that could easily be reused and repurposed by both IOG and external developers. Its core components will include a networking protocol for distributing data across peers via pub/sub, as well as APIs for interacting with data sources like IPFS, Cardano, and Ethereum. It will include an application standard that allows users to run community-created applications on their local machine.
Benefits unlocked by the MVP include:
Improve the trustworthiness and resilience of Catalyst by replicating data sources and executing code locally on user machines
Reduce risk of censorship and / or regulatory shutdown of important infrastructure and services by distributing UX and data across decentralized networks
Reduce operating costs for IOG Catalyst team by sharing requirements for storage and compute across user machines
Provide learnings that can be leveraged across IOG initiatives including Partnerchains and Scalability, without any cost to IOG, since development costs are covered under grants awarded in Catalyst Fund10
It is envisioned that the Hermes node could be extended to communicate with other blockchain ecosystems, creating a cross-chain Supernode capable of processing data from various sources to deliver value to end users. Because it is already connecting a network of peers to distribute and host data for various purposes, the Hermes node could sensibly become something like an app store in the future, by adding an interface for user discovery of applications and modules. These aspirational statements warrant further review and discussion, but demonstrate the ambitious nature of the project.
The initial scope of the Hermes engine will realize just the minimal pieces required to create a Catalyst-compatible voting Dapp, Athena. This includes foundational modules like time and logging, as well as defining standardized application and module specifications, so that creations can be understood across computers.
Future improvements will be made to add new modules in support of new use cases. The usefulness of the engine will grow with every new reusable module created to solve a particular problem. One specific area of interest is adding additional blockchain followers to offer easy-to-use multi-chain infrastructure to Dapp developers.
Internal discussion with other IOG teams including Mithril, Hydra, Cryptography, and Midnight reveal that other teams could benefit from the general purpose capabilities in scope for the Hermes MVP. Notable points of interest for other IOG initiatives like Partnerchains include the ability to leverage Hermes for replacing the Substrate GPLv3 licensed execution engine and for facilitating the development of a cross-chain Supernode.

Rethinking how the proposal template walks you through the process
Education, assistance, and feedback linked to every individual question in proposal template (Niels)
Extending data attached to every object flexibility over time - what constraints do we need to think about?
How do we think about making this decentralize-able?
Think more in terms of file system VS file storage (Steven)
Every new edit becomes a new file in IPFS - not updating a db
Multiple edits are multiple files - let me toggle between versions
Feedback on a question / segment level
Ability for overall AND question specific comments
Working toward micro rewards
If there is a proposal update - auto hide all comments attached to previous version - give commenter noti / task to reattach if they want
Comments get attached to a particular version - feedback loop for commenters, resolving, re-attaching to a new version - commenter task
Flexibility of UI
2 types of data (Steven)
static and rarely changed biz logic - eg fund setup
flexible, dynamic stuff often updated - eg proposal tempalate
UI doesn’t need to be defined on the fly - we can render stuff based on data objects, but overall app structure doesn’t need to change much to context - commitment to prior to decision with flutter, material3 (Sasha)
How do we decentralize not just data, but also the work, interactions, and decision  making? (Niels)
Registration Questions
15min
Based on wallet connect | wallet found / not found | Can we triggered different target pages? Based on a call-2-action in the top-menu. Not auto-direct.
Is role registration needed for every fund?
And why not give users all registrations at once, and if they don’t use them. well they don’t use em. If the user has to register for everything they might want to do, it becomes a bit tedious. Just some questions no rush.

DECIDED","How can we ensure that the redesign of the Catalyst Voices' design WIP aligns with architectural and engineering requirements, while also incorporating data-driven design principles, decentralization, and a flexible UI for registration questions and the proposal module?","To ensure that the redesign of the Catalyst Voices' design WIP aligns with architectural and engineering requirements, while also incorporating data-driven design principles, decentralization, and a flexible UI for registration questions and the proposal module, the following steps can be taken:

1. Review lofi wireframes and discuss 'designing with data' thinking, with emphasis on combining questions, education and assistance / actions. Identify any clear MVP vs post-MVP features and collect additional inputs to refine the new Form Builder.
2. Consider extending data attached to every object flexibility over time, and think about making it decentralize-able. Think more in terms of file system VS file storage, where every new edit becomes a new file in IPFS, not updating a db. Multiple edits are multiple files, allowing users to toggle between versions.
3. Implement feedback on a question / segment level, with the ability for overall and question specific comments. If there is a proposal update, auto hide all comments attached to previous version, and give commenters a notification/task to reattach if they want.
4. Ensure flexibility of UI by rendering stuff based on data objects, but keeping the overall app structure consistent. Consider how to decentralize not just data, but also the work, interactions, and decision making.
5. For registration questions, consider basing it on wallet connect, wallet found/not found, and triggering different target pages based on a call-to-action in the top-menu. Determine if role registration is needed for every fund, and consider giving users all registrations at once.
6. Deliver a minimally functional proposal module for M2, with a focus on the proposal module's flexibility and data-driven design principles.

These steps will help ensure that the redesign aligns with architectural and engineering requirements, incorporates data-driven design principles, decentralization, and a flexible UI for registration questions and the proposal module."

"Goal: complete conceptual designs across all product segments, and translate them into 1st draft of clickable prototypes for further iteration based on internal / external feedback, by the end of February. This aligns with when Niels / Bojan will start splitting focus between Catalyst & Voltaire related work, and also when we hope to start onboarding new flutter application developers.
At time of writing, initial sketches of lofi experience have been created across all segments. Aggressive timeline below reflects significant amount of thinking and discussion that has taken place. Week is to be spent consolidating, refining MVP vs post-MVP, and cleaning up for pipeline from lofi > hifi.
Approach:
Niels works ahead on aspirational designs per segment. By end of week long sprint, have both lofi aspirational concept, as well as more focused view constrained to MVP that can be handed off for hifi refinement (mockup)
Bojan to pick up segments from Niels and translate them into hifi prototype using UI kit for look/feel and components (prototype)
Mimicing the lofi > data-structure sync > UI kit > hidef ui workflow.

What does it take?
Not List (What is it not)","Considering the context, what key factors define the success of building Catalyst Voices' 30-second elevator pitch, and how can we measure their impact while ensuring scalability and quality, keeping potential obstacles and bad habits in mind?","The success of building Catalyst Voices' 30-second elevator pitch is defined by several key factors, including clarity, brevity, relevance, and memorability. To measure their impact, we can use metrics such as engagement, comprehension, and recall rates. We can also gather feedback from our target audience to assess the effectiveness of our pitch.

        To ensure scalability and quality, we need to maintain a consistent brand message and tone across all communication channels. We should also regularly review and update our pitch to keep it relevant and engaging.

        Potential obstacles and bad habits that could hinder our success include using jargon or technical language that may be unfamiliar to our audience, failing to clearly articulate our value proposition, and not being concise enough. To overcome these challenges, we should focus on simplifying our message, emphasizing the benefits of our platform, and practicing our pitch to ensure we can deliver it confidently and effectively.

        Ultimately, the success of our 30-second elevator pitch will depend on our ability to effectively communicate our unique value proposition and differentiate ourselves from competitors. By focusing on clarity, brevity, relevance, and memorability, we can create a pitch that resonates with our target audience and drives engagement and growth for Catalyst Voices."

"NOTE: This is a draft section, not all concept will be used from the start, but it’s good to get familiar with them. Although the concepts will probably be subject to change as the Catalyst Voices system design progresses.
Typo’s included
Innovation Appstore & Business Logic
The wealth is in the network. Instead of building a one-shot application, we are building conversational app infrastructure and we start simple by making our proposal template actionable over time. By thinking in an Catalyst Innovation Appstore (CIA ;), We slowly teach people (First internally, later externally) that they can choose their innovation-models of their choice. We are in the data-shaping and energy-channeling business, as value is organised data, or Data-management systems, but I don’t like the word management, as it might imply static data.
Actionable Content
//description needed
Archetypes
There are three main archetypes that can be found in any domain.
Perfect Joe/Jane - This person knows what he/she wants, knows what is needed, and knows how to get it done. You should not bother these people too much which fluff, give them the tools and let them get to work. They will figure it out.
Deliver my Vision - This person has a clear vision, but still wants guidance how to get from A to B. Supporting this person with great tips and tricks, and a streamlined workflow will set this person up for success.
Inspire Me - This person does really know what it wants, but it does like to get inspired with content / ideas & proposals when they see them. Often this triggers actions in the person to take the next steps.
Other popular archetype systems are personality wheels, brand archetypes, and personality tests.
Ability Tracks
Removing limiting beliefs through self-connection is one of our ability track missions. This involves a lot of unlearning/relearning and self-development. This all starts with self-awareness which some people have by nature, and others need to develop. Being able to stay in the moment is perquisite training before all else. Design Principle: Nudge people into meaningful action through intrinsic motivation and storytelling.
Action/Activity Tracker
Instead of nudging, action tracks just highlight things Perfect Joe's / Janes did. They can set objectives if they want to, but it's more of an activity tracker that  might set Badges if people want too.
Catalyst CLI
Catalyst Command Line Interface is an idea to make our system powered by a command line. This allows us to experiment and test (requirement from Discovery 2022) and create a system that’s highly flexible and tailors to meaningful actions from the start. // This concept just arose so needs more thinking, but is a well known approach for system development. // Not eat your own dogfood, but design the system with the system is the direction of the thinking here.
Conversational Apps
A conversational app is a selection of conversational scripts that use story-structures and data-structures over time to shape data/ideas/concepts from Spark to Winning proposal. An example of a data-structure is the F11 Proposal template. Yet this misses before, during, after thinking like Setup, Effort, Rewards / Follow up actions.
// Conversational Interaction Design / Make Information Actionable course needed.
Data flow & Data Types
All data is equal, but some data is more equal than others. (Animal Farm, by George Orwell adaptation.)
If we want to move towards distributed decision-making systems we need to bring data to their respectful owners. Physically moving data between peers is a challenge but also opens up a plethora of opportunities. A data-type is meta-data attached to data, that uses an (inverse)hashtag system.
Think those old tube systems in banks, that used air pressure to move money around in the building. Often from the workfloor to the high security top-level.
Flow / Success Formula
Intent x Purpose x Meaning
Individual, Shared, Collective.
// needs description
Spaces
Every space, which is nothing more than a data-container or directory has it's own narrative. This narrative must be compelling and give people a feel of responsibly and impact. We are solving real world problems, and that's not for everybody. The biggest obstacle people face is their limiting beliefs which are powered by news/propaganda.
Privacy by Design
By Ann X. & Katina M.  // Get notes ASU.
Blockchain from a social perspective
Blockchain is the collective memory we miss in our daily lives. As human's biggest obstacle is that we forget, but the emotions events create stress in our bodies. (Think C19 and induced trauma.) Language turns emotions in actions, Emotions are energy in motion. We can design on top of chain (real world assets) or we can design with language over time/epochs/blockspace. The different impact of both approaches need to be discussed, as social system design focuses on the positive impact in people’s daily lives and works back towards the systems we need to achieve that.
Brands, Space, Pools, Containers & Crates
All effort is encrypted by default (Privacy by design) and people can choose to add team-members to their pools/projects. Pool consists of data-containers, data-containers contain crates.
Pool: Individual Private
Nobody can see the data that is in this pool.
Pool: Private Team
All effort is encrypted by default (Privacy by design) and people can choose to add team-members to their pools/projects.
Pool: Public
When teams decide they want a time-boxed round of feedback, they can change the state of project to public (total), or they can select specific segments they flag for incentives (comments / reviews / collaboration request / ???)
Pool: Permissioned
Rethinking how we use data in decentralized systems is key.
Pools contain Containers contain Projects/Proposal in crates.
By adding entities/people to pools or specific projects people can control access. Changing data does not work like in real time systems, we add specific tasks to sub-segments of a proposal. So we introduce system like ping-pong, and please review x within 12 hours.
(This needs more thinking). Our brain is not fit for information overload so thinking in Tides & Waves might be a good angle (biomimicry)
Design with Data-structures over time/epoch/blockspace.
Cardano uses 5 day epochs. This is a great way to guide and time-box incentives.
Thinking is blocks of 5 days gives us the opportunity to 'plan' incentives in the future, as we know that at some point in the future an epoch # will come around.","""How can the concept of 'Ability Tracks' and 'Action/Activity Tracker' be utilized to nudge individuals towards meaningful actions and remove limiting beliefs through self-connection and intrinsic motivation?""","The concept of 'Ability Tracks' and 'Action/Activity Tracker' can be utilized to nudge individuals towards meaningful actions and remove limiting beliefs through self-connection and intrinsic motivation by first identifying the individual's archetype and tailoring the approach accordingly. For the 'Perfect Joe/Jane' archetype, the system can provide tools and resources for the individual to figure things out on their own. For the 'Deliver my Vision' archetype, the system can offer guidance and support through tips and tricks, as well as a streamlined workflow. For the 'Inspire Me' archetype, the system can provide content and ideas to inspire the individual to take action. The 'Action/Activity Tracker' can then be used to highlight the actions taken by the individual, allowing them to see their progress and accomplishments, which can further motivate them to continue taking meaningful actions. Additionally, the 'Ability Tracks' can focus on removing limiting beliefs through self-connection and intrinsic motivation, starting with self-awareness and training to stay in the moment. The design principle of nudging people into meaningful action through intrinsic motivation and storytelling can also be applied to further support the individual's journey towards self-connection and intrinsic motivation."

Create a little process together to improve data-structure quality.
When the Data-structures are in place, UI design becomes much easier (DP: Collect/Understand before you Design.
Extensive topic list for later:
Data-architecture;
Data Hierarchy (Data-Significance), Data-Structures, Data-grouping, Data-levels, Data-sets, Data-types, Data-permissions, Data-control, Data-over-time & Data-versions. (All concepts are reasonably easy, when they come together they are powerful, but also needs code support to remove overwhelm.)
Exercise, sort these 3 words: Purpose, Intent, Meaning on hierarchy/significance. (Most important one first.)
Mindset Shift: We are designing a system of systems (relational data application), not a website.

This process will include considerations for data hierarchy, data-significance, data-grouping, data-levels, data-sets, data-types, data-permissions, data-control, data-over-time, and data-versions. The ultimate goal is to create a system of systems, rather than just a website, and to prepare for the development of a Web3/P2P UI/Data kit for a relational data application. This kit does not yet exist, but it is being prepared for Catalyst and the Web3/P2P community."
"Catalyst - People Powered Innovation.
Keeping people, not machines, at the center of decision-making. (Value driver for the Catalyst Brand?)
By creating an decentralized collaborative workspace (Notion & Loop are centralized workspaces), we enable people to do their best work supported an by a best-practices innovation Appstore (1 simplified method to get started). By bringing continuous grading to Design challenges, Meaningful Projects & Traction Objectives we move from quantity to quality, and from work to impact (meaningful work).
By bringing quality projects and other investors to a Funding Tracks Space we turn challenges/projects into funded Dream teams with plans.
And by creating an ADA economy space we capture best-practises that others can pick up to create viral loops. (repeat)
Identified Spaces to describe:
000 - General Interface
100 - Discover Space Guests (No Wallet account connected)
200 - Decentralized Workspace (Wallet account connected)

900 - Ecosystem Systems","How does the Catalyst brand's value driver of keeping people at the center of decision-making manifest in its creation of a decentralized collaborative workspace with continuous grading, funding tracks, and an ADA economy space?","The Catalyst brand's value driver of keeping people at the center of decision-making is manifested in its creation of a decentralized collaborative workspace in several ways. Firstly, by creating a decentralized workspace, the Catalyst brand enables people to have more control and autonomy over their work, as they are not reliant on a centralized authority. This empowers individuals to make decisions that are in line with their values and goals, rather than being dictated by a hierarchical structure.

Secondly, the use of continuous grading in design challenges, meaningful projects, and traction objectives helps to shift the focus from quantity to quality, and from work to impact. This ensures that people are able to focus on producing meaningful work that has a real-world impact, rather than simply completing tasks for the sake of it. By prioritizing quality over quantity, the Catalyst brand is able to ensure that people are able to make decisions that are in the best interests of the project and its stakeholders.

Thirdly, the creation of funding tracks provides a space for quality projects and investors to come together and form funded dream teams with plans. This enables people to collaborate on projects that have the potential to make a significant impact, and to secure the resources they need to bring their ideas to life. By providing a space for people to come together and collaborate on projects, the Catalyst brand is able to ensure that decisions are made collectively, with the input and perspectives of multiple stakeholders.

Finally, the creation of an ADA economy space captures best practices that others can pick up to create viral loops. This helps to ensure that the knowledge and expertise gained through the Catalyst brand's decentralized collaborative workspace is shared and disseminated widely, enabling more people to benefit from the insights and experiences of others. By creating an ADA economy space, the Catalyst brand is able to ensure that decisions are made with the benefit of a wide range of perspectives and experiences, further emphasizing the importance of keeping people at the center of decision-making."

        Pools are unhinged elements that further organize data within Spaces. They enable the creation of multiple instances of a Pool with language transition-labels, facilitating data categorization and management.

        Together, Spaces and Pools provide a robust framework for data organization and movement within the distributed decision-making network. They allow for efficient data handling, ensuring seamless communication and decision-making across the network."
"Hermes Executive Summary
Hermes & Athena's Design, Decisions and Considerations
What makes Flutter a good choice for building cross-platform apps for Catalyst?","What are the key reasons why Flutter is a suitable option for creating cross-platform applications for Catalyst, as outlined in the Hermes and Athena's Design, Decisions and Considerations executive summary?","Flutter is a suitable option for creating cross-platform applications for Catalyst for several reasons, as outlined in the Hermes and Athena's Design, Decisions and Considerations executive summary. Firstly, Flutter's hot reload feature allows for quick and easy iteration during the development process, which can help to improve productivity and efficiency. Additionally, Flutter's use of a single codebase for multiple platforms can help to reduce development time and costs, as well as ensuring consistency across different platforms. Furthermore, Flutter's strong community support and active development can provide access to a wealth of resources and libraries, making it easier to build complex applications. Finally, Flutter's ability to create visually appealing and customizable user interfaces can help to enhance the user experience and differentiate the application from competitors."
"A Dataconomy has different traits. Here I want to describe what the difference in thinking is.
Web2
Web3
Interaction design in pages.
Interaction design in conversational scripts (that can be loaded in pages (loose), or use more transitional UI approach ‘Chat Made Actionable’ interfacing down the line (strict). Hybrid can work as well.
Network Thinking has data-containers moving between Nodes/Spaces. The containers get enriched with significant and non-significant data-structures, that unlock abilities.
UX STORYLINE EXAMPLE
USE CASE
An example for an individual posting a proposal (let’s keep things simple for starters)
A proposer is finished with working through the proposal template (Data-structure), and used the proposal segment anchors to easily navigate through the proposal template sections. (Design Principle: No back and forth mania in Voices!)
The proposer changes the state of the proposal (data-container) to ‘Ready to publish to funding track’, and the system (assistant) asks if the proposer want to do a pre-flight check. The proposer select resume this later. And the Assistants responds, cool, I will add this to your Inventory to pick up.
The inventory get a little red dot 1, this might happen after disconnect of the user, not to create addictive behaviors.
As the proposer has other business to attend to the proposer locks his environment and goes about his/her business.
An example of a simple conversational scripts. (Screenplay writing if you will), that bring our real and virtual worlds closer together.
--
After the ‘Pre-flight check’ might be good to using Publishing Jargon?
The Proposal (data-container) goes to the Grants Space.
- People sort, select, and cast their votes.
Niels Note:
Will detail this story over time as there need to be a lot more detail, but to get an impression this is ok.
Potential Script extension post MVP:
On Tally result ‘Funded’ a data-structure 'Proposal-Funded / Proposal-Not-Funded / Proposal Approved / …' is added to the Proposal (data-container), and a first Milestone Budget NFT is awarded. (I believe first payment always goes through?) This gives the ‘winner’ the ability to request funds from treasury and disperse funds at his/her discretion. And is part of decentralized thinking. Don’t do important actions on behave of someone else. (like putting money into a wallet address, without noticing because most wallets have no fund received notification features)
Lived Experience:
I lost hundreds of dollars because I didn’t notice funds where already paid, and ADA was in a terrible downfall. So having the option to extracts funds when I wanted would have been amazing. (But also needs to have a pressure limit)","How does the concept of a ""Proposal-Funded"" data-structure in a Web3 Dataconomy enable decentralized thinking and potentially prevent loss of funds?","The concept of a ""Proposal-Funded"" data-structure in a Web3 Dataconomy enables decentralized thinking by allowing the 'winner' of a proposal to request funds from the treasury and disperse funds at his/her discretion. This empowers the winner to control their own funds, rather than having someone else perform important actions on their behalf. This can prevent loss of funds, as seen in the lived experience where funds were lost due to not noticing that they had already been paid and the value of ADA was in a downfall. By having the option to extract funds when desired, the winner can avoid such losses."
"Context
The need for a versatile and efficient framework to develop applications across multiple platforms (Web, iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, and Windows) led us to consider various options like Kotlin Multiplatform and React Native. Flutter emerged as the most promising solution due to its wide-ranging platform support, single codebase feature, and robust widget library.
Assumptions
We need to build scalable, robust, and maintainable systems.
With capabilities that extend efficiently to web, desktop, and mobile platforms.
React Native cannot build for Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux from one code base.
A great React Native app requires Swift/Objective-C/iOS and Kotlin/Java /Android engineering. A code base with 5 languages.
Facebook has moved on from using React Native
Facebook (that developed and maintained React Native) also cited technical limitations as a reason for its decision to pull out including performance issues and difficulties with maintaining a consistent codebase across different platforms.
Flutter’s easy learning curve means the development team can learn and adapt to Flutter and Dart for cross-platform development, offering redundancy within the team.
The performance and compatibility of Flutter-built applications are adequate across all targeted platforms.
Libraries that are used by other IO tribes, such as JS used by React apps like Lace, can be shared and used by Flutter developers.
Technology evaluation
Flutter, developed by Google, has several compelling arguments for use as our primary technology for cross-platform app development:
One Codebase
: With
Flutter
, we write one codebase for Web, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. This saves significant development time and effort. You also have a consistent and uniform app across all platforms, which enhances the user experience and reduces the likelihood of platform-specific bugs.
Dart language
: Flutter uses the
Dart language
. Dart is easy to understand for JavaScript, Swift, or Java developers. Dart supports object-oriented and functional concepts, making it easy for developers to use and providing a good structure for application development.
Learning Curve:
Dart is generally considered easy to learn if you come from a background in JavaScript, Swift, Java, or any other modern programming language
Performance
: Flutter apps are compiled into native code, which gives them near-native performance. They don't rely on intermediate languages or interpreters, which can significantly impact an app's speed and performance.
Rich and customizable widgets
: The Flutter framework provides a rich set of beautifully crafted widgets that can be customized to suit our brand's look and feel for a unique and professional appearance.
StackOverflow trends,
reports
support the above, Flutter as a top technology, desirable skill to hold today because:
Flutter is platform agnostic
Flutter simplifies and speeds application development
Flutter is easy to learn and easy to use (+ has excellent documentation)
Flutter scales well
Hot Reload:
This feature significantly increases developer productivity by enabling changes to be reflected instantly without requiring the app to restart. It's an excellent feature for UI development and testing new features.
Less Testing:
Because Voices app will be built from a single codebase, the quality assurance process will become more straightforward and quicker. This is because we only need to write automated tests once for both platforms. Moreover, a single codebase reduces the chances of platform-specific bugs.
Excellent Documentation:
Flutter has an extensive range of documentation and tutorials available, which is an invaluable resource for our development team. Google and the Flutter community have made concerted efforts to make starting with Flutter as seamless as possible. This also makes the onboarding process for new team members more manageable.
Faster Time to Market:
With a single codebase, robust widgets, and a simple testing process, development time can be drastically reduced. This allows for a faster time to market, which allows us to demonstrate value quicker.
Growing Community and Support:
Flutter is backed by Google, which provides a certain level of confidence and security. The community around Flutter is rapidly growing, with increasing libraries and resources available to solve various everyday tasks and issues.
Integration with Firebase
: Flutter supports Firebase, Google's mobile development platform. Firebase provides many features, such as analytics, databases, messaging, and crash reporting, that can be easily incorporated into a Flutter app.
Code Push
:
Code pushes for mobile apps can significantly reduce the time and effort involved in deploying updates, allowing for faster iteration and responsiveness to user feedback.
Remote Widgets
: Mechanism for rendering widgets based on declarative UI descriptions that can be obtained at runtime.
Over 30 teams at Google use Flutter
:
Resourcing
In March 2024, Catalyst began interviewing for Senior Flutter engineer roles with more than 50 candidates currently being screened by the Talent team after only 48 hours of advertising.
For short-term needs we are engaging
Scalac, Sotatek, or Proxify vendor
resources ($25-$55 ph) to  begin work on Voices in April while hiring in the right skills. For comparison Palo-IT vendor quoted Catalyst $800 per day per Flutter engineer.  Alongside Flutter resources, vendors are also being engaged to increase QA capacity in the team.
Risks
Potential complications in accessing some native features and hardware-specific functionalities on each platform. Mitigated by the team’s willingness to explore documentation and find technical answers (see Flutter Resources below)
Additional testing across different platforms is needed to ensure consistency and performance. Mitigated by early planning and best estimations of additional QA tasks and resourcing.
Flutter's desktop and web support is less mature than its mobile support, which might lead to unforeseen challenges. Catalyst Voices MVP is for desktop only so the mobile support risk is hopefully mitigated by time and community growth and know how for Flutter platform.
Consequences
Streamlined development process with a unified codebase, reducing development and maintenance costs.
Increased ability to rapidly deploy updates and new features across all platforms simultaneously.
Dependency on a single technology stack may pose challenges if Flutter does not evolve as expected.
Cross-tribe reusability
Integrating External Libraries with Catalyst Voices
In cases where our Flutter projects need to leverage functionality from external JavaScript, Swift, or other libraries—developed by different teams within or outside our organization—we will create Flutter (Dart) packages that serve as bridges to these libraries. This approach enables us to maintain the benefits of Flutter's cross-platform capabilities while utilizing these external libraries' strengths and unique features.
Example:
We use
js
binding to bridge to wallets that are chrome plugins.  We would not want to use it for much more.
And heres an example however not everything we do is
js
:
https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-components/cardano-serialization-lib/
This is used almost uniformly by developers to serialise transactions.  Built in rust, it runs in the browser as WASM so
js
can use it, and so can flutter.

"Why does decentralization matter for Catalyst?
Most crypto projects are like a man with a hammer when it comes to decentralization - everything looks like a nail. Rather than seeking to solve a problem with decentralization, they take it as a given that more decentralization is better. This can be a costly mistake, since decentralized software is more complex and difficult to build compared to centralized alternatives. Furthermore, most ""decentralized"" applications retain one or more single points of failure, rendering those costly investments in decentralization useless.
We make the case that decentralization is a mission critical objective for Catalyst because it:
Reduces regulatory risk for
IOG
by removing fiduciary responsibility in the fundraising process. We do not custody funds, we simply manage software that allows users to custody funds in a permissionless way
Unlocks new untapped markets by removing the constraints faced by fund custodians,
such as KYC, that prevent existing fundraising services from operating in 90% [TODO: get actual figure] of the world
How do Hermes, Athena, and Catalyst Voices fit together to realize a vision for decentralized fundraising?
The decision to invest in this product portfolio directly supports the objectives outlined above.
Hermes provides an engine for building, distributing, and running applications with fully decentralized backends - not merely consuming distributed data sources as part of larger centralized system as most ""Dapps"" do today. A successful proof-of-concept has already demonstrated how the Hermes architecture might run an application backend that relies only on distributed data sources. The MVP for this project will demonstrate how that architecture can be used to support a voting app with a fully distributed backend, that is capable of supporting privacy-preserving encrypted ballots, which can be used in Catalyst.
This vision for Hermes is significant for several reasons:
Novel Catalyst application for voting
Cross-chain utility
Reusable components
First, it offers a novel voting application for transparent and verifiable decision-making that is unmatched in the current competitive landscape. Although blockchain-based voting solutions like
Cardano Ballot, SundaeSwap Governance,
and others exist, none of them have fully decentralized application backends, and
none of them support encrypted ballots for voter privacy
. Similar limitations may apply to technology internal to IOG such as Hydra and Partnerchains. Initial discovery into Hydra use cases can be found
here
.
Second, it opens
opportunities for cross-chain applications
that can serve to attract developers and users to the Cardano ecosystem, even if they have invested significant financial resource on other blockchains.
Finally, the Hermes MVP will have several capabilities that are immediately reusable to developers inside and outside IOG, like decentralized registration tracking and voting power calculation that can be configured to new use cases.
Athena serves as the frontend companion to the Hermes MVP. It will explore how we might build, deploy, and deliver a fully decentralized application UX, that can be run locally on user machines using the Hermes client, creating the possibility for fully decentralized application experiences that are safe, secure, and censorship-resistant. In our analysis, UX will be the final frontier in building decentralized applications, and we intend to position ourselves as leaders and trailblazers on that frontier.
Upon delivery of the MVP for both Hermes and Athena, Catalyst will have the means to run voting events that are
actually
decentralized, on both the front and the backend. If Catalyst voting can be run on fully distributed infrastructure shared with the community, this may not only significantly reduce operating costs for Catalyst by utilizing community compute and storage resources, but also reduce regulatory risk by positioning IOG as a participant in the process rather than a centralized administrator. At this point, further investments may be made to realize all capabilities required by the end-to-end fundraising process in a fully decentralized way.
Catalyst Voices serves as a pipeline to realize this vision of a fully decentralized fundraising platform. It will be built from the ground up to be ""decentralize-able"", though it will remain centralized through its first iterations. This will allow us to advance the state of the art of fundraising, without being constrained by the complex architecture required for full decentralization.
First, we will focus on defining the critical business logic required by various parts of the fundraising process in a centralized way. After validating and hardening that business logic through Catalyst funding rounds, we will translate the same logic into Hermes modules that can be run in distributed fashion. If we can validate the efficacy of those modules through rigorous proof of concept testing on the Catalyst testnet, then we will promote them to production to serve as the backend to the Voices platform. In this way, Catalyst Voices will evolve over time to use fewer and fewer centralized backend services, until it is capable of being run using only decentralized data sources. In this mature state, we will continue to maintain a centrally hosted of version of the Voices UX, but users will have the choice of interacting through that central point OR participating using only their local Hermes node.
But where is the money?
To this point, we have emphasized the cost savings and risk reduction offered by these development initiatives. However, what we find most exciting is the potential to unlock new, expansive, and scalable revenue generating opportunities in the fundraising space.
Today, Catalyst relies solely on community-approved grant funding to generate revenue. This is great to support operation in the short term, but our ambition is to deliver a revenue-generating product that can sustain itself over time, regardless of Cardano community sentiment. Some of starting points for the revenue-generation potential of Catalyst are detailed
here
and include:
Pay-to-play: users pay fees to participate: membership, per-submission
Investor Reports/ Product Discovery Data: publication to publish startup intelligence to customers
Grantmaking Software: provide Saas
Innovation fund Service Provider: Provide a managed service for other ecosystems
Fundraising / Crowdfunding Platform: Donations / match funding, taking a fee per tx
Advertising & Sponsorship: promoting partners in key real estate (e.g
projectcatalyst.io
and reports)
Catalyst has begun to explore expanding our capabilities as a fundraising engine to compete with fundraising platforms like Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, and Patreon. These platforms generate billions of dollars on fees taken from peer to peer transactions, and we are well positioned to compete due to:
Existing community of innovators and participants seeking to raise funds, earn rewards/incentives, as well as backers eager to support their favorite projects, allowing us to jump-start the creation of a two-sided marketplace
Reduced transaction processing fees compared to incumbents, allowing us to undercut their prices and win price-sensitive customers
Novel features like conditional fundraising unlocked by technology like smart contracts, allowing us to radically differentiate ourselves from current offerings
Fewer regulatory constraints due to decentralization, allowing us to access global markets untouched by incumbent competitors
The revenue potential of this play is explored in greater detail
here
.
These ideas and other promising avenues of revenue generation are to be explored and sharpened during the upcoming leadership meeting to take place February '24 in Longmont, CO.","How does the decentralization of Catalyst's fundraising process through the use of Hermes, Athena, and Catalyst Voices contribute to reducing regulatory risk for IOG and unlocking new markets, while also providing a novel voting application and cross-chain utility?","The decentralization of Catalyst's fundraising process through the use of Hermes, Athena, and Catalyst Voices contributes to reducing regulatory risk for IOG by removing fiduciary responsibility in the fundraising process.

Firstly, by enabling micropayments, Web3 technologies allow users to monetize their content and engage in value-for-value exchanges with their audience. This creates a more equitable and sustainable ecosystem for content creation and consumption, where users are incentivized to create high-quality and engaging content that truly resonates with their audience. This, in turn, fosters a sense of genuine interest and two-way communication, as users are motivated to engage with each other in a more meaningful and authentic way.

Secondly, by enabling subscriptions from the blockchain, Web3 technologies allow users to access premium content and services on a recurring basis. This creates a more predictable and stable revenue stream for content creators, who can then invest more time and resources into creating high-quality content and engaging with their audience. This, in turn, fosters a sense of loyalty and commitment between users and content creators, as both parties are invested in building a long-term and mutually beneficial relationship.

Finally, by promoting the deweaponization of language, Web3 technologies can help to create a more inclusive and respectful community culture. By discouraging the use of aggressive or divisive language, Web3 technologies can help to create a safer and more welcoming environment for all users, regardless of their background or perspective. This, in turn, can help to foster a more diverse and vibrant community, where users are free to express themselves and engage in open and honest dialogue with each other.

Overall, Web3 technologies, such as micropayments and subscriptions from the blockchain, can play a crucial role in promoting genuine interest and two-way communication within Web3 communities, while also promoting the deweaponization of language. By creating a more equitable and sustainable ecosystem for content creation and consumption, Web3 technologies can help to foster a more engaged and committed community, where users are motivated to engage with each other in a more meaningful and authentic way."

"Hermes Executive Summary
The Hermes engine offers a novel architecture framework for developing and running web3 applications. It is a collection of generic Web-3 Libraries that are orchestrated in an Event-driven manner and provide imperative APIs. It allows pluggable scrips implemented as WebAsm components to implement application-specific logic and use a curated set of well-defined Web-3 APIs, offering a high degree of of customization and reusability.
Development of the MVP is being paid for by grants awarded via community approval in Catalyst Fund10, and will be constrained to the needs of a Catalyst voting Dapp (Athena). The MVP will consist of both Catalyst-specific and general purpose modules , that could easily be reused and repurposed by both IOG and external developers. Its core components will include a networking protocol for distributing data across peers via pub/sub, as well as APIs for interacting with data sources like IPFS, Cardano, and Ethereum. It will include an application standard that allows users to run community-created applications on their local machine.

Q4 2022
Views from IOG Director of Architecture
Note from Benjamin Beckmann (Dir. Architecture):
Catalyst - Hermes & Athena
The Catalyst application is an exemplar that requires both Web3 and Web2 capabilities to deliver our community solution. For example, the Catalyst application must observe on-chain registration and calculate the registrant’s voting power from Cardano observations. In addition, Catalyst must allow an operator to publish fund details and topics, collect proposals, and facilitate review, voting, award, and monitoring of fund performers. These capabilities are specific to the needs of Catalyst as it is embodied Today.
In addition, minor modifications, such as observing registration and calculating voting power from another chain or storing fund and proposal data in a decentralized data store, can be added simply because the initial design abstracts details using a configurable framework of services per application.
In addition to extending the Catalyst application to other chain ecosystems, the framework can also empower the development of other applications. This framework consists of two main sections: the execution engine named Hermes and the Hermes Application which is named Athena for Catalyst.
Hermes provides standard services that a Web3 application requires, such as event processing when an observed chain produces a block or coordinating a pub/sub interaction with another Hermes node participating in the same application.
An application written on top of Hermes is called an hermes application.  For example, the coming implementation of Catalyst is an Hermes application called Athena. The Athena application comprises WASM business logic that consumes the underlying Hermes services through a common set of easy-to-understand interfaces. Therefore, the Athena application can easily interact with a blockchain by observing events and submitting transactions. In addition, an Athena application can provide users with an experience powered by WASM, a compilation target for many modern languages, including Rust, TypeScript, Scala, and many others.
The combination of Hermes and Athena has a direct application to the development of the Catalyst application, however it can also be applied to other applications as well. Two notable applications are replacing the Substrate GPLv3 licensed execution engine and a super node. The Hermes framework will provide an upgraded version of an execution engine for WASM simply by leveraging the newly delivered capabilities of WASM. In addition, it uses the same foundational libraries (libp2p and IPFS) which are common in many other decentralized applications. The Hermes engine can also observe and transact with other chains, and an accompanying Hermes application like Athena can implement the business logic required to facilitate the interaction needed to deliver a super node.
Current Catalyst features
Below is a set of core technical features that Catalyst operates to set up, run, and conclude a voting event campaign. Please note, that the below list doesn’t account for any steps or features that take place in Catalyst
Launch
of Infrastructure and voting event orchestration
Registration
: users register their voting power by connecting their Cardano wallet to the Catalyst voting app via QR connection or registration via CLI
Ideation
: managed by Ideascale, 3rd party SaaS platform used for proposal submission and community review stages
Snapshot
: fetch voting power given a connected wallet, freeze voting power based on stake distribution on mainnet, the custom definition of voting power based on transformation to raw token holdings
Voting
: Private voting via homomorphic ZKP, supports 1k votes per second, batch submission of votes, and voting power assigned based on staked ADA at a fixed point in time, preventing double spend/double voting.
Continuous publication
of the immutable voting log during the fund, verifiable by the community.
This is used to give the community assurance that no votes were not included, removed, or stuffed before the tally.
It was deployed for the first time in F10 and was very well received by the community.
Tally
: Tally completed by committee (n=1 today), verifiable by community
This builds on the features of (7) and allows the community to independently verify that the tally we publish matches the votes cast.
This feature was also deployed for the first time in F10 and was also very well received as a major technical improvement that gave better surety to the community about the integrity of the process and results.
Rewards distribution
: Calculate and distribute rewards on Cardano mainnet based on participation data
Experience has shown that the Catalyst Community wishes to see Project Catalyst progress as both a technical system and an operational fund.  Failure to deliver feature parity, at least to the extent observable by the community would risk being seen to be going backward and has a real risk of damaging the reputation of Project Catalyst.
There are ethical considerations at play when considering the trade-offs between voting in public or in private. For starters, millions of ada are at stake so coercion is one of the most important risks Catalyst aims to mitigate and preserve the integrity of the vote. To address this, Catalyst voters have benefited from protections afforded by ZKP encryption allowing them to vote without fear that their wallet balances and voting opinions public known to bad actors.  Private voting is a critical requirement as without it, the security, authenticity, and sovereignty of the individual is at risk.
Many of the features of Project Catalyst, both operational and technical serve security and integrity purposes which have been built up over the last 10 funds.  Reduction in feature parity will inevitably risk decreasing the security and integrity of the system and risks opening it to attack or obvious “gaming of the system”.
When we discuss changes to the system with the community we always need to include an explanation on how this improves the integrity or security of the system.  it would be very difficult to explain that the integrity or security has been compromised because of technical decisions that were made seemingly unilaterally within IOG or the Project Catalyst tribe.
Project Catalyst Architecture challenges
There are several technical and architectural challenges with the current project Catalyst stack, built around Jormungandr.
A summary of the technical and architectural challenges are:
Jormungandr is difficult to deploy and operate.
It requires a tightly controlled deployment to meet our throughput requirements, which prevents us from decentralizing the operation of the voting blockchain.
The rigid implementation of Jormungandr makes it difficult to add new vote types, to experiment with different voter groups and participation requirements, or use different voting power algorithms.
We can not have an event that has both private and public voting in the same event,  meaning delegated representation and liquid democracy cannot be realized, as envisioned, with the current stack.
Too many manual processes in the setup of the Jormungandr blockchain present opportunities for errors or potentially malicious behavior. We have automated some of these in the last six months, but getting all the data ready to run an event on Jormungandr is still long, complicated, and requires significant human effort.
Tallying results is manually triggered and all participants in the tally must be present and honest.
A dishonest participant can not produce an invalid tally, but they can prevent a tally from being conducted fully.
The treasury paper discussed M of N participants in Tally but the original implementation of the cryptographic voting in Jormungandr did not implement it.
Each blockchain is large (We budget 6GB/node) and stored in AWS at our cost.  This is in addition to all vote information databases and other fund data (milestone module data, payments data, etc).
We need to store this data redundantly on at least 4 nodes, and this translates directly to our cost base, as we are required to both operate all the nodes and also provide storage for them.
The estimated cost of a single fund from running Jormungandr alone is approximately USD 8,000.
Calculated at approx 480hrs of uptime during the voting and tally, for 4 machines, at approximately $4 per hour.
Cheaper machines are not an option, as extensive testing has shown that these are the cheapest machines available on AWS that provide the necessary performance characteristics required of Jormungandr to properly and reliably sustain the voting load of a Catalyst fund.
We have created an ad-hoc mechanism to allow for observability and auditability of the vote and tally, but it still requires Project Catalyst to periodically publish data for this purpose and can not be independently collected.
Starting points for evaluation
Catalyst processes have been designed as best as they can be within the limitations of the existing infrastructure, and any shift to an alternative needs to be considerate of the volume of transactions, data, and encrypted, private voting characteristics that Catalyst has implemented today.
Moreover, Catalyst voting is now operating at the scale of hundreds of thousands of votes being cast with privacy preservation over each 2-week voting period. This presents a problem for propagating a high throughput of votes to the Cardano blockchain without network congestion or poor UX. As the desired state is to fully verify that votes have been cast and received on-chain, this means that output for processing this volume of votes is either:
each vote is posted on-chain to Cardano, where privacy preservation is maintained.
This risks network congestion and a bad user experience.
It also requires an entire multi-gigabyte transaction load of votes for every fund to be carried by every full Cardano node in perpetuity even when the individual ballots cease to have meaning or value.
Voting on-chain also necessarily incurs a transaction cost, which could be significant as privacy-preserving encrypted votes are large (Several KB).  The cost of voting could dissuade participation.
eac
h vote is posted on-chain to Cardano, where privacy is compromised and voter choices and directions become public.
This risks our differentiation and reputational damage as Catalyst prides itself on being the first ZK voting application in the Cardano ecosystem
Public votes are smaller, but it still requires that every full Cardano node carries every vote in perpetuity even when the individual ballots cease to have meaning or value.
Smaller non-encrypted public votes would cost less from a transaction fee perspective to post to the blockchain, but they would still cost something. That could still disincentivize participation.
votes are rolled up so the voters' choices are both private and cost-efficiently posted on-chain.
Voters need a method to validate that their ballots have been included in the final tally, that the election was conducted with integrity, and that the results posted to the chain reflect the true result of the fund.
Voting off-chain is effectively free from a voters' perspective, and the individual ballots need only be stored in a decentralized manner while they are required for tally or audit purposes.  Once the result has been certified as valid, the individual ballots can be safely destroyed.
Key test for the ‘solution’
Does the solution allow for private voting at scale?
All registered voters (60k) voting on 1000 proposals across 10 separate vote plans (a vote plan is a category / challenge / funding track) over 2 weeks of voting
Metrics-driven testing for:
liveness (How responsive is the system under high distributed loads);
stability (how reliable is the system under high distributed loads); and
scaling (How fast is the system under high distributed loads).
Effects of more nodes added to the network
The assumption is that as nodes increase, network stability and performance are either maintained or demonstrably improved.
Challenges with existing CIPs and Catalyst voting
https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-36/
CIP-36 does not disambiguate between individual voters and dReps.
CIP-36 does not allow us to put different rules or conditions on dReps due to the fact we can not disambiguate them.
CIP-36 required GVC to maintain a centralized and IOG-controlled database of dReps to disambiguate them, which means there is no feasible way for the community to participate in that process, or contribute to it.  With CIP-36 all dReps would require to be registered with and vetted through IOG, including personally identifying information.
CIP-36 has no way to validate that a registration controls its voting key.
CIP-36 does not allow us to capture registrations for any other roles, such as Proposers, Tally committee, audit committee, proposal reviewers, etc.
https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0095
CIP-95 is related solely to voting on-chain for CIP-1694 actions.  It has no applicability to Project Catalyst outside of this.
I
t is NOT part of any current scope, but we could track CIP-1694 registrations in the Catalyst Voices app.  We could also track and detect requests from Project Catalyst to withdraw funds from the treasury for the next catalyst fund.  Participants in Catalyst could then be advised giving them a focused and informed opportunity to consent to the governance action to withdraw the funds for Catalyst or not.
Further,  being registered as a CIP-1694 style dRep could be a pre-requisite for registering as a Project Catalyst dRep, and even though the roles are distinct, they could be related to an individual registered stake address.  This could be additional information provided to voters to help inform their choices for dReps.
There may be other opportunities to use CIP-1694/CIP-95 functionality as a value add to Catalyst Voices, but it is not a feature required of the existing stack.
Active on-going collaboration.
Mithril/Hydra  (with comments from both Arnaud & Sebastian)
Hydra
- Provides isomorphic blockchain interfacing capabilities we can leverage in future version of
Hermes
.
Collaborating with their team on a common pub/sub protocol (with the  desire to utilize it in both mithril distribution and ).
“In 2023 Hydra, Catalyst, Research, and the CF collaborated on “Voting on Hydra” with the explicit goal of using that within future Catalyst architecture. This voting system has been used on mainnet during Cardano Summit to tally votes from users on ecosystem projects.”
Arnaud Bailly
NB: Details of the collaboration can be found here:
https://github.com/cardano-foundation/hydra-voting-poc
“Both, Mithril and Hydra, would be infrastructure which is made available through Hermes, very much the same way as the Cardano network is made available as a source.”
Sebastian Nagel
TxPipe Pallas Library - Mithril snapshot support.
The Hermes node will consume Mithril snapshots as one source of Cardano blockchain data.  This was enabled by earlier work performed by txpipe, and our contribution to the Pallas project has enhanced support for Mithril snapshots within the
Pallas Library
.
Sidechains/Partnerchains
Throughout the design of Hermes, we have been actively collaborating and information sharing with the Sidechains Tribe at an architectural level.
Midnight
Throughout the design of Hermes, we have been actively information sharing with the Midnight Tribe at an architectural level.
Voting on Hydra / Cardano Ballot
During 2023, the CF conducted a “voting on hydra POC” in collaboration with IOG.  Project Catalyst was involved closely with that work, as we were both providing consultation about the nature and characteristics of Project Catalyst that were attempting to be modeled and also evaluating the outcome for suitability with the Project Catalyst use case.
The POC successfully demonstrated a voting system running inside hydra heads, although it was far from feature parity with the Current catalyst system, and uncovered a number of technical challenges that would need to be resolved.
Voltaire Hydra Voting - From Federated to Decentralised [DRAFT]
Cardano Ballot is an evolution of the Voting on Hydra POC and the limitations observed in the POC remain in the current implementation of Cardano Ballot.
Notably:
Hydra head operators are required to commit a certain amount of ADA necessary to advance the hydra network state.  The service has high CPU and memory requirements.
All registered voters would need to have an NFT minted for them as part of their registration.  Hydra head operators would need to mint these NFTs for all voters.
There needs to be an NFT minted for every possible vote a voter could cast, as burning the NFT is what is used to prevent double voting.  As there is no voter registration and all stake address can vote, this would be a very large amount of NFTs to mint for an election the scale of catalyst.
Existing catalyst voter registration mechanics would not be applicable because the solution works with smart contracts which can not access metadata in registrations.
There are a number of avenues where the hydra-head operator can upset the election as outlined in the report.
No method is suggested for decentralizing or choosing head operators for an election.
There is no support for an independent audit of the voting on the heads.
There is no support at all for cryptographic voting and no easy way to add those features.  it is also unclear if there would be sufficient performance necessary to execute the required functions at the scale of a catalyst fund.
Anecdotally, it’s been told to the Catalyst team that Cardano Ballot prefers to vote into a database than a hydra head because of the limitations stated in the
report from CF
What is Hermes?
Hermes is an Engine for running Catalyst as a decentralized dApp frontend.
Hermes is a collection of generic Web-3 Libraries.  They are orchestrated in an Event-driven manner and provide imperative APIs.  This allows pluggable scripts implemented as WebAsm Components to implement application-specific logic and use a curated set of well-defined Web-3 APIs.
dApps do not need to concern themselves with how IPFS file storage or Pub/Sub works, or how blocks are synchronized from a blockchain.  These details are handled for the dApp which can focus on its specific business logic rather than solving common interfacing problems repeatedly.
For the MVP only the minimum subset of modules required by the Athena application will be implemented.  Further modules and APIs are planned, but they are all post-MVP, and they can be either implemented by the community as open-source contributions, by Project Catalyst to enable new functionality required by an extended Athena application or by another project within IOG if they wish to use the Engine.
Dividing the Web3 modules from the business logic makes it significantly easier for others to collaborate, and for contributions to be reviewed.  It also makes it easier to clearly distinguish between enabling modules and the applications underlying business logic.

What is a Hermes App?
A Hermes App is an archive of files that primarily consists of:
Metadata about the App
Its name
Who published it
Signatures proving who published it
A Collection of Static Files which are served by the Hermes Node as standard static web pages.
This allows a full UI/UX to be bundled with a Hermes App.
The App front end can be written in any language or tooling that targets browser-based apps. (React or Flutter for example)
It is no different from a standard Web2 application except that it DOES NOT get served from a centralized server but by the Hermes node itself.
This contrasts with every other system of which we are aware, that requires a Web2 server run by a centralized and trusted authority to host and serve the UI of the dApp at their cost.
A Collection of compiled Webasm modules that provide the equivalent of backend business logic to the front-end app served by the Hermes node.
The app can bundle any business logic it needs.
The front-end app interacts with the business logic the same as it would if it were a Web2 application, but the requests target the local Hermes node ONLY.
The WebASM modules have access to pre-integrated APIs that provide common re-usable Web3 components and data processing/storage libraries.  This simplifies the backend logic to simply process that data and execute the necessary business logic based on it.
As Hermes applications are bundled in an archive of files, the Hermes node itself can run any application that has been properly constructed.  This allows easy re-use of the Hermes Engine without over complexity that results from trying to orchestrate multiple independent services.  The difficulty in orchestrating multiple services is a key reason why end users are unable to successfully deploy dApps locally, and why most dApps do not even attempt local deployment.
This is not an exhaustive specification of the Hermes App architecture but it highlights the most important features relevant to this report.
What is Athena?
Athena is a Hermes App initially targeted to decentralize voting for Project Catalyst, designed to run on the Hernes engine.  For the MVP Athena will be targeted to ONLY provide a decentralized voting mechanism, which allows Project Catalyst to finally deliver on its promise of decentralized and auditable voting.
Athena implements a traditional Voting Bulletin board and does not attempt to store votes on a “block-chain” which is not a data structure that is historically suited to high volume transaction load.  Further, individual ballots can be large, especially if they are encrypted as in Project Catalyst.  An individual fund can have 1000’s of Proposals, and 1000’s of voters, which can lead to extremely high data storage requirements.  It's unusual in high-volume voting events (such as state-run elections) to retain individual ballots
(For example, UK legislation requires individual ballots to be archived only for 1 year and 1 day after an election, after which they are destroyed)
.
A blockchain is inherently immutable so all ballots would be stored immutable and forever, this would create a very large and mostly pointless resource load on any blockchain that attempts this at the scale of Project Catalyst.  Project Catalyst with Athena will adopt a Voting Bulletin board where the ballots are immutable and stored for the duration of the event, once the result is known and audited, then the individual ballots can be forgotten, there is no ongoing requirement to keep them once the outcome is validated through an open and auditable process.  Individual community members could elect to retain all individual ballots from an election but there is no operational requirement to do so.  The result of the election could then be immortalized on-chain as that data is very small by comparison to the entire set of ballots and also is the most important information from an election.
Athena will leverage this behavior to enable high-volume decentralized voting without being restricted to a slow blockchain for vote storage.
The design of Athena and its Voting bulletin board architecture is a result of:
Our own experiences with delivering 10 Catalyst Funds and operating the Project Catalyst infrastructure.
The experimentations Project Catalyst participated in with Voting on Hydra.
Input from IOG Research.
What Hermes and Athena are not?
Hermes is not a blockchain.
Hermes does include interfaces to blockchains (initially Cardano, but it's designed to interface to any desired blockchain).
The interfaces are made by pre-existing libraries, with thin wrappers to interface to the Event-driven model of Hermes.
Hermes is not a Pub/Sub networking protocol.
Hermes does include preexisting IPFS and LibP2P libraries to provide Node-to-node communication.
A thin layer interfaces these pre-existing libraries to a Hermes event-driven model.
Hermes provides common building blocks to make using Pub/Sub and Distributed hash tables easier from a dApp but does not include any specific Node to node protocol as they are provided by individual Hermes applications.
Hermes is not an incentivized node.
Unlike a blockchain where Nodes are required to secure the network, Hermes nodes are only required if the users of the nodes wish to use the features of a particular Hermes Application, and in our case Athena.
Individual Hermes applications may provide incentivization, such as Project Catalyst, which offers rewards to voters and other roles.  This is not because a user ran a Hermes node, it’s because they participated in Project Catalyst.
Individual users derive value from the functionality a Hermes Node and the Athena application provide them.  For example, no one is incentivized to run the current Catalyst Voting application on mobile, and yet thousands of people have downloaded and installed the app, solely because of the utility it provides them.
Athena is not a final implementation of project Catalyst.  It is an MVP implementation of decentralized voting only.  its purpose is to allow us to conduct further experiments, and iterate to add more and more decentralized functionality to project Catalyst.
Athena is not the only app that can run on a Hermes node.
Athena is just the dApp written by the Catalyst team to provide a decentralized Voting MVP upon which we can conduct further experiments regarding decentralizing and extending the capabilities of project Catalyst.
Example Research input from IOG Research
Key features of the Athena voting solution.
All participants (voters or observers) can observe in real-time the casting of votes.
Voter privacy is assured through advanced cryptography.
A number of nodes will act as redundant vote storage bulletin boards.
These are intended to be run by the community.
Similar to fully redundant disk storage, this system only requires a single faithful bulletin board to properly collect votes for the system to have integrity.
A decentralized UI usable through a local browser will allow the voter to see all proposals in a fund, check their voting power (independently of any central authority) and cast a vote.
Every node running the Athena application will be able to individually validate if the votes that are cast by a voter are valid.
The voting bulletin boards will not deliberately store multiple votes for the same proposals from the same voter.
Should that happen a very simple deconfliction will occur where the votes with the lowest hash will be used and all others conflicting ballots will be discarded.
It is impossible to forge a vote, so the only reason the ballots could be different is if a voter themselves is deliberately attempting to cast multiple conflicting ballots.
Deconflicting this way eliminates all possible reward for a voter attempting to do this.
Decentralized Tally is intended, but is NOT part of the MVP, which only attempts the voting portion of the Catalyst Fund.
if the MVP was used in a production setting the votes cast over it would be added to the votes received from the traditional system and the tally conducted as it is now, but with the union of all non-conflicting votes.
In this scenario, if a voter votes on both the legacy system and the MVP decentralized voting system, we would take the vote on the legacy system as the authoritative choice for the voter.
Why build an Engine and an App?
Many of the problems faced by Project Catalyst in meaningfully decentralizing the voting experience are common to other dApps.  In addition, Project Catalyst itself changes rapidly, fund on fund.  By dividing the project into an Engine and an Application that runs on it, we can:
Minimize or Eliminate redundant work for the large common requirements shared by dApps.
Improve division of labor between Application work and Common infrastructure work.
Improve the ability to iterate on the application and experiment with different interfaces.
Enhances re-use by the community of the Engine and the Application.
Allows us (or the community) to implement the Application in various languages while maintaining a common, well-tested, high-performance code.
Creates a well-defined event-driven paradigm that makes it easier to reason through and implement complex Web-3 systems without needing to understand the low-level details.
Why not deploy a Web 2 App like other dApps do?
Project Catalyst is currently deployed as a Web2-based dApp.  Web2 apps are:
Complex to deploy, which limits or excludes the community from using the systems we produce in any meaningful way.
They also tend to accumulate non-opensource components (such as deployment scripts) which further restrict the community's ability to develop with us.
Difficult for third parties in the community to contribute to the codebase because it's difficult to run the system.
Concentrates power into the hands of a single operator, which also concentrates risk.
Decentralized applications attempt to minimize or eliminate these concerns. Blockchains are decentralized, but if the dApps that interact with them are exclusively run by trusted centralized operators only then they suffer from all of the issues (both legislative and community) that traditional Web2 apps suffer from.
Hermes and Athena is a first step at truly decentralizing the apps that interact with blockchains.  It is built for the purposes of Project Catalyst but with full knowledge that this is an issue for the entire ecosystem and not just Project Catalyst.
Jormungandr was an attempt at decentralized voting, but it fails because it can not scale.  The further the nodes are from one another the slower the network gets, and it can not maintain the very high (and growing) loads required of Project Catalyst without being tightly controlled by a single operator.  Which defeats its purpose.
Collaborating post-MVP on Hermes Development
The intention with the Hermes engine is that is can be collaboratively developed.
For example, the Side chains / Partner chains tribe could add functionality to interface to Ethereum. This can be done as any standard open-source project would collaborate. For example, other Web3 grant providers such as SingularityNet’s Deep Funding programme, already have a wallet linking tool to allow both Ethereum and Cardano wallets to cast votes on proposals made to the Deep Funding program. Hermes would compliment and benefit from additional contributions.
The added subsystem would be available to dApps once integrated but would have no impact on any dApp that didn't use it.   This allows for the Hermes Engine itself to grow , evolve, and gain capabilities without unnecessarily breaking any existing dApp that can run on it.
Practically speaking, as soon as the core executor and Hermes application package are implemented and operational any contributor both internally and externally could meaningfully use the Hermes engine and collaborate on new features or Web3 interfaces.
The current plan according to the Roadmap for Hermes and Athena is that this level of functionality will be reached between the End of Milestone 2 and before the End of Milestone 3 - targeting Summer 2024.

"Hermes Executive Summary
The Hermes engine offers a novel architecture framework for developing and running web3 applications. It is a collection of generic Web-3 Libraries that are orchestrated in an Event-driven manner and provide imperative APIs. It allows pluggable scrips implemented as WebAsm components to implement application-specific logic and use a curated set of well-defined Web-3 APIs, offering a high degree of of customization and reusability.
Development of the MVP is being paid for by grants awarded via community approval in Catalyst Fund10, and will be constrained to the needs of a Catalyst voting Dapp (Athena). The MVP will consist of both Catalyst-specific and general purpose modules , that could easily be reused and repurposed by both IOG and external developers. Its core components will include a networking protocol for distributing data across peers via pub/sub, as well as APIs for interacting with data sources like IPFS, Cardano, and Ethereum. It will include an application standard that allows users to run community-created applications on their local machine.
Benefits unlocked by the MVP include:
Improve the trustworthiness and resilience of Catalyst by replicating data sources and executing code locally on user machines
Reduce risk of censorship and / or regulatory shutdown of important infrastructure and services by distributing UX and data across decentralized networks
Reduce operating costs for IOG Catalyst team by sharing requirements for storage and compute across user machines
Provide learnings that can be leveraged across IOG initiatives including Partnerchains and Scalability, without any cost to IOG, since development costs are covered under grants awarded in Catalyst Fund10
It is envisioned that the Hermes node could be extended to communicate with other blockchain ecosystems, creating a cross-chain Supernode capable of processing data from various sources to deliver value to end users. Because it is already connecting a network of peers to distribute and host data for various purposes, the Hermes node could sensibly become something like an app store in the future, by adding an interface for user discovery of applications and modules. These aspirational statements warrant further review and discussion, but demonstrate the ambitious nature of the project.
The initial scope of the Hermes engine will realize just the minimal pieces required to create a Catalyst-compatible voting Dapp, Athena. This includes foundational modules like time and logging, as well as defining standardized application and module specifications, so that creations can be understood across computers.
Future improvements will be made to add new modules in support of new use cases. The usefulness of the engine will grow with every new reusable module created to solve a particular problem. One specific area of interest is adding additional blockchain followers to offer easy-to-use multi-chain infrastructure to Dapp developers.
Internal discussion with other IOG teams including Mithril, Hydra, Cryptography, and Midnight reveal that other teams could benefit from the general purpose capabilities in scope for the Hermes MVP. Notable points of interest for other IOG initiatives like Partnerchains include the ability to leverage Hermes for replacing the Substrate GPLv3 licensed execution engine and for facilitating the development of a cross-chain Supernode.

epic
Rethinking how the proposal template walks you through the process
Education, assistance, and feedback linked to every individual question in proposal template (Niels)
Extending data attached to every object flexibility over time - what constraints do we need to think about?
How do we think about making this decentralize-able?
Think more in terms of file system VS file storage (Steven)
Every new edit becomes a new file in IPFS - not updating a db
Multiple edits are multiple files - let me toggle between versions
Feedback on a question / segment level
Ability for overall AND question specific comments
Working toward micro rewards
If there is a proposal update - auto hide all comments attached to previous version - give commenter noti / task to reattach if they want
Comments get attached to a particular version - feedback loop for commenters, resolving, re-attaching to a new version - commenter task
Flexibility of UI
2 types of data (Steven)
static and rarely changed biz logic - eg fund setup
flexible, dynamic stuff often updated - eg proposal tempalate
UI doesn’t need to be defined on the fly - we can render stuff based on data objects, but overall app structure doesn’t need to change much to context - commitment to prior to decision with flutter, material3 (Sasha)
How do we decentralize not just data, but also the work, interactions, and decision  making? (Niels)
Registration Questions
15min
Based on wallet connect | wallet found / not found | Can we triggered different target pages? Based on a call-2-action in the top-menu. Not auto-direct.
Is role registration needed for every fund?
And why not give users all registrations at once, and if they don’t use them. well they don’t use em. If the user has to register for everything they might want to do, it becomes a bit tedious. Just some questions no rush.

DECIDED","How can the proposed 'designing with data' thinking and flexibility of UI be leveraged in the development of the Campaign Builder & Proposal Editor and Registration Questions, while also considering decentralization of data, work, interactions, and decision-making for the Catalyst Voices project?","The proposed 'designing with data' thinking and flexibility of UI can be leveraged in the development of the Campaign Builder & Proposal Editor by reviewing the lofi wireframes and discussing the combination of questions, education, and assistance/actions. Identifying clear MVP vs post-MVP features and collecting additional inputs to refine the new Form Builder is also important. The epic of rethinking how the proposal template walks users through the process can be achieved by incorporating education, assistance, and feedback linked to every individual question in the proposal template. Extending data attached to every object's flexibility over time, while considering constraints, is also crucial. Decentralization of data can be achieved by thinking in terms of file system vs file storage, where every new edit becomes a new file in IPFS, and multiple edits are multiple files, allowing users to toggle between versions. Feedback on a question/segment level, with the ability for overall and question-specific comments, can also be implemented. Additionally, working toward micro rewards, where if there is a proposal update, all comments attached to the previous version are automatically hidden and commenters are given a notification/task to reattach if they want, can be considered.
        
        For the Registration Questions, based on wallet connect, wallet found/not found, different target pages can be triggered. Role registration may not be needed for every fund, and users can be given all registrations at once, with the option to use them if needed. Decentralization of work, interactions, and decision-making can be achieved by considering how to decentralize not just data, but also the work, interactions, and decision-making for the Catalyst Voices project. The UI can be rendered based on data objects, but the overall app structure doesn't need to change much to context. A commitment to a decision with Flutter, Material3 can be made."

Kriss Baird","Who is responsible for ensuring that risks and dependencies are properly assessed, logged, and tracked in JIRA, and what are the specific JIRA links for managing risks, issues, and dependencies?","The responsibility for ensuring that risks and dependencies are properly assessed, logged, and tracked in JIRA lies with the Tribe Leader. The specific JIRA links for managing risks, issues, and dependencies are:

        Risks:

"Goal: complete conceptual designs across all product segments, and translate them into 1st draft of clickable prototypes for further iteration based on internal / external feedback, by the end of February. This aligns with when Niels / Bojan will start splitting focus between Catalyst & Voltaire related work, and also when we hope to start onboarding new flutter application developers.
At time of writing, initial sketches of lofi experience have been created across all segments. Aggressive timeline below reflects significant amount of thinking and discussion that has taken place. Week is to be spent consolidating, refining MVP vs post-MVP, and cleaning up for pipeline from lofi > hifi.
Approach:
Niels works ahead on aspirational designs per segment. By end of week long sprint, have both lofi aspirational concept, as well as more focused view constrained to MVP that can be handed off for hifi refinement (mockup)
Bojan to pick up segments from Niels and translate them into hifi prototype using UI kit for look/feel and components (prototype)
Mimicing the lofi > data-structure sync > UI kit > hidef ui workflow.

https://github.com/input-output-hk/catalyst-voices/issues/207",What is the division of tasks and timeline for Niels and Bojan in the process of completing conceptual designs and translating them into clickable prototypes across all product segments by the end of February 2024?,"Niels will work ahead on aspirational designs per segment, creating both a low-fidelity aspirational concept and a more focused view constrained to the minimum viable product (MVP) that can be handed off for high-fidelity refinement. Bojan will pick up segments from Niels and translate them into high-fidelity prototypes using a UI kit for look and feel and components. The timeline for this process is as follows:

Week 5 (January 29 - February 2, 2024):

* Niels will work on the low-fidelity wireframe for the discovery draft, focusing on lots of brainstorming, distinguishing between the marketing website and the landing page, defining clear and concise narratives for each space, and setting up general UI.
* Bojan will work on the landing page, including the browser extension wallet connect and dynamic CTA by role, and lister components such as user preference to set grid vs cards vs text only, proposal tags and filtering, proposal overview and detail, and lurker content discovery UX.

Week 6 (February 5-9, 2024):

* Niels will continue working on the low-fidelity wireframe, focusing on creating campaign, proposal editor and in-context menu, bringing to voting event/funding track, and syncing with engineering on campaign builder/proposal editor.
* Bojan will continue working on the high-fidelity components and mockups, focusing on the dashboard/take management, navigation, recent activity, priority tasks across spaces, contextual dashboard, and new segment.

Week 7 (February 12-16, 2024):

* Niels will work on the low-fidelity wireframe for the Drep login/wallet connect dashboard.
* Bojan will work on the high-fidelity dashboard for the Drep login/wallet connect.

Week 8 (February 19-23, 2024):

* Niels will iterate and refine existing work and begin scoping out the community engagement strategy.
* Bojan will continue working on the high-fidelity components and mockups.
* There will be a Lace sync on February 20 to review and provide feedback on wallet interactions across connect > register > propose > vote."
"The Catalyst Voices MVP will be delivered as a mobile-responsive web app that is optimized for desktop users. Wallet connect is required for users to perform key interactions like registration, voting, and proposing. This is a well-solved problem on desktop browsers, but is difficult on mobile browsers.
Given that post MVP plans include delivery of native iOS & Android applications to better serve mobile users, minimal effort will be invested to support wallet connect on mobile browsers. This page further explores what options exist for serving mobile users in the MVP.

Method
Description
Effort
Challenges
Value
QR Code Compatibility
Allow mobile users to use the existing QR codes to access the application. This connection method will automatically assign the “Voter” role, but no additional roles may be unlocked with this method, ie can only vote.
Minimal effort to allow QR code compatibility, though we will not invest in any extensions to support new roles.
Once Ideascale is deprecated, only users with the ability to connect a Cardano wallet will be able to submit proposals.
Any user without desktop access may still participate as a voter, ensuring that the transition to Voices does not alienate the large segments of users in areas like Africa, LATAM. They will get the great experience of our responsive web app on mobile browser, despite missing some key capabilities.
Built-In Browsers
Some wallets may choose to implement built-in browsers inside the UX of wallet native applications (think in-app browser view if you click a link in discord). This gives wallet connect capabilities from within the built-in browser.
None for us.
High effort for wallets. Research needed to understand which support this today: Vespr? Eternl? Flint?
TODO: understand if this is on Lace roadmap so we can work closely with them to solve UX challenges.
UX may vary widely based on application compatibility with the way the built-in browser is implemented. Implementations are idiosyncratic to wallets, and we have little control over UX. Extensive testing will be required to understand limitations.
Allow mobile users of wallets to leverage existing built-in browser capabilities to access all MVP features of the Voices experience, with to-be-seen degradation of UX.
Alternative Mobile Browsers with Chrome Extension Support on Android
Android users may have workaround abilities to use wallet browser extensions on mobile.
https://www.makeuseof.com/chrome-extensions-android-mobile/
https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-extensions-android-3325587/
None.
Alternative browsers that support chrome extensions are required, since Android no longer supports them on mobile browser.
UX may vary widely, and we will have no control.
There are no similar workaround options for iOS users on Safari browser.
Android users that are willing to put in some legwork may be able to access all MVP features in mobile, with to-be-seen degradation of UX.
Embedded Wallet In Platform
OUT OF SCOPE
Build a new minimally functional wallet directly inside the application.
High degree of effort, perhaps on par with the entire MVP itself.
TODO: high level analysis of work & effort
There is no funding for this approach, and handling private keys in the app introduces significant security risk. Cost of audit & reviews, in addition to high development cost. Worthwhile future path to explore.
Entirely eliminate the wallet connect problem, so that both mobile & desktop users might enjoy the same great UX.
CIP45
WILL NOT USE
An extension to CIP30 that uses WebRTC to enable wallet connect on mobile browsers
https://developers.cardano.org/docs/governance/cardano-improvement-proposals/cip-0045/
Requires moderate development effort to create new APIs to support communication with wallets that have implemented this protocol.
Uses insecure networking protocol that exposes sensitive information to the broader internet to faciliate wallet connect.
Wallet users with CIP45 implemented could interact with Voices MVP on mobile browser.","How can mobile users access key interactions like registration, voting, and proposing in the Catalyst Voices MVP, considering the challenges of supporting Wallet Connect on mobile browsers?","Mobile users can access key interactions like registration, voting, and proposing in the Catalyst Voices MVP through the following options:

        1. QR Code Compatibility: Mobile users can use existing QR codes to access the application, which will automatically assign the ""Voter"" role. However, no additional roles may be unlocked with this method, meaning users can only vote. Minimal effort is required to allow QR code compatibility, but no extensions will be invested to support new roles.

        2. Built-In Browsers: Some wallets may implement built-in browsers inside the UX of wallet native applications, allowing wallet connect capabilities from within the built-in browser. This requires high effort for wallets, and the UX may vary widely based on application compatibility with the way the built-in browser is implemented.

        3. Alternative Mobile Browsers with Chrome Extension Support on Android: Android users may have workaround abilities to use wallet browser extensions on mobile. However, alternative browsers that support chrome extensions are required, and the UX may vary widely.

        4. Embedded Wallet In Platform: Building a new minimally functional wallet directly inside the application is out of scope due to high development effort and security risks associated with handling private keys in the app.

        5. CIP45: This extension to CIP30 uses WebRTC to enable wallet connect on mobile browsers, but it requires moderate development effort and uses an insecure networking protocol that exposes sensitive information to the broader internet. It will not be used in the Catalyst Voices MVP."

/ Event Data Structure
JSON-Driven Architecture
Adaptive Form Fields
Q: do we need collapsible sections for campaign builder, since it is less complex than proposal editor?
Overall event setup + category setup
data validation is key
+ key requirement = upload
--included in the json schema
Instead of manual upload - stick it in github, then during deployment process, it takes the form from github
+key requirement: reduce handoffs and touches
Insight from fund ops
MVP: just json
PostMVP; visual form builder in UI
+ move the voting + tally logic into cateogry
+ apply all type button to apply same settings across categories ie voting / tally rules - can we have this as module type thingy? - default starting point is everything at the same time, then go make edits for each unique thing - edit a “default” tab
+ using category templates

DECIDED","""How can we design a UI concept that combines utility, education, and actions, and works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile for both Campaign Builder and Proposal Editor, while also considering an enriched data-structure and state machine, adaptive form fields, and versioning in the proposal API?""","To design a UI concept that combines utility, education, and actions, and works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile for both Campaign Builder and Proposal Editor, consider the following:

        1. **Header**: Include a main CTA and account/profile information in the header.
        2. **Left Rail**: Use the left rail for contextual navigation.
        3. **Right Rail**: Utilize the right rail for contextual support.
        4. **Bottom Rail**: Implement the bottom rail for contextual utility.
        5. **Design Patterns/Systems**: Ensure design patterns and systems can be used across spaces.
        6. **Campaign Builder and Proposal Editor**: Combine Campaign Builder and Proposal Editor into a single interface, with a shared bottom ""Batch"" rail for bringing campaigns and proposals to voting spaces, and for pick-list selection.
        7. **Data-structure and State Machine**: Enrich the data-structure over time/stages, considering it as a state machine.
        8. **Form Builder and Event Data Structure**: Implement a JSON-driven architecture for the form builder, with adaptive form fields.
        9. **Campaign Builder Complexity**: Determine if collapsible sections are necessary for Campaign Builder, given its potentially lower complexity compared to Proposal Editor.
        10. **Event Setup and Category Setup**: Include overall event setup and category setup, with data validation as a key requirement.
        11. **Upload**: Incorporate upload functionality, ideally integrated with the json schema during the deployment process.
        12. **Reduce Handoffs and Touches**: Strive to reduce handoffs and touches in the process.
        13. **MVP and PostMVP**: Consider the MVP as just JSON, with a PostMVP visual form builder in the UI.
        14. **Voting and Tally Logic**: Move the voting and tally logic into category setup.
        15. **Proposal API**: Implement a Proposal API with Create/Read/Update/Delete UX, versioning, saving, and text formatting.
        16. **Proposal Data Structure**: Ensure the proposal data structure is well-defined and supports versioning.
        17. **Comments**: Allow comments to be attached to specific versions.
        18. **State**: Define a ""ready for comments"" state.
        19. **Education**: Incorporate education in context, defined along with the campaign builder.
        20. **Milestones**: Consider the number of milestones based on funds requested.
        21. **Open Source**: If the project is open source, ask for a license.
        22. **Conditional Questions**: Include conditional questions inside the base template, as well as category-specific questions.
        23. **Participants**: Ensure the UI concept is suitable for all participants, including Mike McNulty, Alex Pozhylenkov, Joaquin Rosales, Felipe Rosa, Conor Gannon, Stefano Cunego, Sasha Prokhorenko, Steven Johnson, Lucio Baglione, Niels Kijf, Bojan, Blue, Khem, and Alice."

Understand Hermes role outside of Catalyst and possibly move to an independent project
Detailed background, considerations, and solution details captured here:
Hermes & Athena's Design, Decisions and Considerations
, including the following assessment from Ben Beckman (Director of Architecture):
The combination of Hermes and Athena has a direct application to the development of the Catalyst application, however it can also be applied to other applications as well. Two notable applications are replacing the Substrate GPLv3 licensed execution engine and a super node. The Hermes framework will provide an upgraded version of an execution engine for WASM simply by leveraging the newly delivered capabilities of WASM. In addition, it uses the same foundational libraries (libp2p and IPFS) which are common in many other decentralized applications. The Hermes engine can also observe and transact with other chains, and an accompanying Hermes application like Athena can implement the business logic required to facilitate the interaction needed to deliver a super node.

Review Voices against Cardano Ballot and other solutions.
Review Voices against Cardano Ballot and other solutions.
Voices offers unified platform for managing the end-to-end grant process - across proposal management AND voting. Future plans include integration of the milestone module, to also consolidate community driven processes for funded project delivery and accountability
The voting solution inside Voices has several advantages over Cardano Ballot and other solutions such as DripDropz, Summon, and SundaeSwap including:
Encrypted tally to preserve voter privacy
Existing integrations with the rest of the Catalyst Voices platform
Off-chain vote storage that can be fully verified against registration + voting power on mainnet
Voting infrastructure whose operation can be fully distributed to the community if desired
Ability to support cross-chain applications and voting denominated in tokens other than ADA
A deep dive review of the existing voting architecture and alternatives completed in late 2022 can be found here:

Review CIP-95 relationship to Catalyst voting and possible CIP creation.
Review CIP-95 relationship to Catalyst voting and possible CIP creation.
Cardano Dreps and Catalyst Dreps play different roles in different contexts, although they share some similarities in their basic concept (ie delegative democracy)
A unique CIP will be created for Catalyst Dreps, that also includes definition of other roles required by Catalyst process, along with a decentralized role based access control framework for Catalyst Voices, building on discussions with Ricky Rand
As a value add to Catalyst users making delegation choices, we may explore the ability to sign Catalyst Drep registration using Cardano Drep keys generated according to the CIP95 standard - this would provide verifiable proof in the Catalyst Drep profile that the same individual also serves as a Cardano drep

The Hermes engine uses the same foundational libraries (libp2p and IPFS) which are common in many other decentralized applications, making it easily integrable with other decentralized systems.

Background & Key Questions
Discussion, Decisions, & Action Items
Review prototype for minimal functional proposal module to satisfy Voices M2
https://github.com/input-output-hk/catalyst-voices/issues/244
Splash Page
Proposal List
Create Proposal
Save Proposal
View Proposals
Remove metadata for simplicity - make this parallel conversation to push overall designs
Q: anchors and show / hide toggle - remove both of these
TODO: use the ‘ready to publish’ toggle as a way to drop back to home page with new proposal
no need for edit button - will have app recognize my typing, will have autosave - keep it, for relation with right rail
Remove everything above “impactful projects” - make entire splash screen that little section
Summary of changes:
Simplify splash to only the final panel with “impactful projects header”
Remove anchors & toggle from left navigation menu
Remove metadata section
When change status to publish, then return user to proposal list
Review initial data schema to support prototype
https://github.com/input-output-hk/catalyst-voices/issues/246
Fetch Template
Proposal CRUD
approach - remote widget
https://github.com/input-output-hk/catalyst-voices/issues/254
able to separate the views and the business logic
can update proposal template on the fly without updating app version
able to handle multiple proposal template versions in parallel
instead of schema - will have binary that describes it
TODO: unpack approach in upcoming technical discussion

DECIDED","Given the discussion topics and action items in the context, how does the team plan to approach the delivery of the Proposal Module MVP for Voices M2, specifically in terms of the prototype's design, data schema, and Flutter implementation?","The team plans to approach the delivery of the Proposal Module MVP for Voices M2 by first reviewing the prototype design for a minimal functional proposal module. They aim to simplify the splash screen, remove anchors and toggle from the left navigation menu, and remove the metadata section. They also plan to use the 'ready to publish' toggle as a way to drop back to the home page with a new proposal.
        
        In terms of data schema, the team will review the initial data schema to support the prototype and fetch the template and handle Proposal CRUD using a remote widget approach. This approach will allow them to separate the views and the business logic, update the proposal template on the fly without updating the app version, and handle multiple proposal template versions in parallel. They plan to use a binary that describes it instead of a schema.
        
        Lastly, the team will discuss questions on Flutter implementation, specifically rendering the template and the Proposal Editor. Participants in the discussion include Mike McNulty, Alex Pozhylenkov, Joaquin Rosales, Felipe Rosa, Conor Gannon, Stefano Cunego, Sasha Prokhorenko, Steven Johnson, Lucio Baglione, Niels Kijf, Bojan, Blue, Khem, and Alice. The action items include unpacking the approach in a technical discussion and reviewing the prototype for minimal functional proposal module to satisfy Voices M2."

"The processes that support Catalyst Operations must be compliant with the leading industry guidelines, in order to ensure that IOG and its employees are protected from legal & regulatory liability.
Several key points of compliance include…
Not sending funds to individuals in sanctioned countries eg Iran, North Korea
Providing payments oversight to ensure that funds are used for their agreed purpose
Enabling independent 3rd parties to verify voting outcomes against immutable source of truth for…
Voters & voting power
Proposals
Votes
Tally results
Statement of milestones
Positioning IOG as a service provider in the Catalyst process, and ensuring that fund management & payments happens through an entity that is legally distinct from IOG
Compliance in these areas will be achieved by the following process & development initiatives:
Require KYC & acceptance of a grant agreement for all funded proposers (F11 & beyond - owned by Operations team)
Create Catalyst entity that externalizes all risky processes to point outside of IOG (??? - owned by Operations team)
Facilitate community review of milestone delivery & payment disbursements to ensure proper use of funds (Milestone Module in place today; to be incorporated into Voices at unspecified future time)
Publish records of key artifacts in each fund to Cardano mainnet (F12 & beyond)
Implement DiDs for funded proposers, in order to satisfy compliance requirements, while protecting individual privacy AND minimizing sensitive data maintained by IOG (F13 optimistic, dependent on ATALA team ability to implement a solution according to our needs with reasonable degree of effort)
Incorporate role registrations, DiDs, artifact publishing, and grant agreements into the unified UX offered by Catalyst Voices (F14 and beyond) to simplify user inputs & operational processes critical to compliance
Open questions include…
Are processes like KYC required for all parties, or only those receiving funding above a certain threshold?
What are the specific compliance requirements or guidelines that must be satisfied?
Current OKRs being elaborated with this page:
Clarify if current on-chain voter registration is compliant.
Clarify compliance requirements for support roles
Having on-chain transactions of all the proposals
Votes ?
Having on-chain transactions of all the tallies (including voting outcomes)
Having on-chain transactions of all the statement of milestones","What are the specific initiatives being taken to ensure that compliance requirements are met in the Catalyst Operations process, such as the implementation of DiDs, the creation of a Catalyst entity, and the incorporation of role registrations and grant agreements into the Voices UX?","The specific initiatives being taken to ensure that compliance requirements are met in the Catalyst Operations process include:

        1. Implementing Decentralized Identifiers (DiDs) for funded proposers to satisfy compliance requirements while protecting individual privacy and minimizing sensitive data maintained by IOG. This is planned for F13, but is dependent on the ATALA team's ability to implement a solution according to the needs of the project with a reasonable degree of effort.

        2. Creating a separate Catalyst entity to externalize all risky processes outside of IOG. This initiative is owned by the Operations team.

        3. Facilitating community review of milestone delivery and payment disbursements to ensure proper use of funds. This is already in place with the Milestone Module, and will be incorporated into Voices at an unspecified future time.

        4. Publishing records of key artifacts in each fund to the Cardano mainnet. This is planned for F12 and beyond.

        5. Incorporating role registrations, DiDs, artifact publishing, and grant agreements into the unified UX offered by Catalyst Voices. This is planned for F14 and beyond to simplify user inputs and operational processes critical to compliance.

        Additionally, there are ongoing efforts to clarify compliance requirements and guidelines that must be satisfied, as well as determining if current on-chain voter registration is compliant and clarifying compliance requirements for support roles. The goal is to have on-chain transactions of all proposals, votes, tallies (including voting outcomes), and statement of milestones."
"Project Catalyst - Seed Account Guidelines
Confidential
Last updated: Feb 2, 2024 by
Daniel Ribar
TL’DR: This document outlines key definitions and processes in place that govern access and management of Project Catalyst seed account/wallet by the Catalyst Team at IOG. This is a living document that follows the iterative process. Please review in detail for updates. Changes are expected and frequent. This document is not exhaustive but indicative.

Catalyst Internal Guidance
- below is the Catalyst team internal guideline on approach:
Catalyst team to periodically evaluate forecast requirements for the upcoming outgoing payments and existing liabilities.
If the forecast signals less than 60 calendar days operational buffer to cover outstanding liabilities, the Catalyst team is to notify key stakeholders about the need to execute CR in the near future and begin drafting MIR CR document.
Draft MIR CR document is shared for peer review with CAB members during a scheduled meeting first.
If the draft MIR CR format/language is agreed upon, all key stakeholders required to approve are notified via email and
#cat-seed-mir
slack account
Q&A meeting is scheduled to answer any outstanding questions/queries.
Asynchronous option is available in the form of Google Doc comments/email.
Once all outstanding questions/doubts are resolved - document is ready for formal approval.
Once all key stakeholders have agreed and formally approved the MIR CR - a date is proposed and scheduled for a physical execution of the MIR. At that point - all key stakeholders relevant to the MIR physical execution must commit relevant resources to carry out the transfer.
On a date of execution - instructions are followed as per MIR CR and transfer is executed according to the specification outlined in the MIR CR.
Stakeholders are notified of outcome and relevant transaction IDs are shared, Catalyst Seed Account ledger is updated.
Approvals
Approvals for MIR transactions are always listed in the CR directly with the position and name listed for each of the stakeholder entities. There can be more than one approver per entity. It is desirable that all entities approve and endorse MIR type of requests.
MIR CR needs to be clearly labeled with a date and ‘APPROVED’ next to the name of the person that requires approval as per following suggested format:
JOHN SMITH - APPROVED YYYY-MM-DD
All persons listed on the document need to do so before MIR CR is formally approved and teams can proceed to the next step of actual execution.
Execution
Funding documentation is shared on
#cat-seed-mir
channel and relevant Catalyst Seed Account operator (The Catalyst Team at IOG) is notified to schedule date/time for distribution
Physical execution requires signing of at least 5 of 7 Genesis keys.
IOG: 3
CF: 2
Emurgo: 2
Approving entities should clearly identify which mode of execution is going to be endorsed by each of the participating entities - direct co-signing or via delegation. This has to be clearly identified and communicated in advance of physical preparations.
Transaction is enacted on a live execution call scheduled in advance. If any party has delegated their keys to another - this needs to be clearly identified and made clear about approval and intent to execute in the written form (e.g. email). There should be no ambiguity/doubt about intent and approvals.
MIR type of transfer is possible to be submitted on blockchain ONLY within the first 48 hours of every epoch (5 days in length). Missing this period window means teams need to wait until the next epoch boundary, This is a hard ledger rule and cannot be overcome. Transaction itself needs to be adopted in a block in the first 48 hours of the epoch.
The general process is as follows:
IO creates the tx using using special scripts - to add repository
IO creates MIR txbody
IO sends MIR txbody to Emurgo/CF
CF/Emurgo witness and send witness file back to IO:
cardano-cli transaction witness --tx-body-file tx-registered-mir-0-0.txbody --out-file tx-registered-mir-0-0.del0-witness --signing-key-file delegate-keys/shelley.000.skey
IO assembles all witnesses, adds own IO keys and submits to blockchain:
cardano-cli transaction assemble --tx-body-file tx-registered-mir-0-0.txbody --out-file tx-registered-mir-0-0.txsigned --witness-file tx-registered-mir-0-0.del0-witness --witness-file tx-registered-mir-0-0.del1-witness --witness-file tx-registered-mir-0-0.del2-witness --witness-file tx-registered-mir-0-0.pay-witness
Every relevant transaction ID is to be shared/noted immediately upon execution with all key stakeholders and saved for auditing purposes.
These notifications are outlined/stipulated in the MIR CR directly for each of the participating entities.
Public/Ecosystem Alignment
(If applicable) All relevant public key stakeholders are notified via relevant communication channels:
Accountable:
Daniel Ribar
To note - this has not been exercised historically but something that needs to be planned in lieu of Voltaire changes. There's a plan underway to consider and implement a relevant communication medium for tracking treasury in greater detail.
Process to be updated
as per this JIRA ticket
Returns/Refunds (PENDING)
Projects that cannot complete/start execution
Projects wish to donate/pay back ADA received
To be formalized
as per this JIRA ticket
This section is currently under development as it currently represents a very rare occurrence.
Qs to consider - exchange rates, timing, legality, etc.
To note: It is not possible to make Cardano Treasury refunds, ledger rules do not allow for this. Refunds/returns are handled via local Catalyst Seed Account only at the moment. This may change with ledger rule updates in the future.
Outgoing Transfer Processes
All outgoing payments need approval from the CAB (Change Advisory Board). Requests are prepared and approved locally by the Catalyst team (this includes every supported documentation), then forwarded to the IO Change Advisory Board for further Q&A/review/and approval. Approvals are required jointly between all sponsors/approvers across relevant management/operations. Namely:
Catalyst Tribe level sponsors/approvers for any outgoing transfer requests are with:
Kriss Baird
;
Daniel Ribar
;
Harris Warren
Executive level sponsors/approvers for any outgoing transfer requests are with:
IOG VP of Voltaire
Nigel Hemsley
IOG COO

        7. Once all key stakeholders have agreed and formally approved the MIR CR, a date is proposed and scheduled for a physical execution of the MIR. At that point, all key stakeholders relevant to the MIR physical execution must commit relevant resources to carry out the transfer.
        8. On the date of execution, instructions are followed as per the MIR CR and the transfer is executed according to the specification outlined in the MIR CR.
        9. Stakeholders are notified of the outcome and relevant transaction IDs are shared. The Catalyst Seed Account ledger is updated.
        10. Approvals for MIR transactions are always listed in the CR directly with the position and name listed for each of the stakeholder entities. It is desirable that all entities approve and endorse MIR type of requests.
        11. The MIR CR needs to be clearly labeled with a date and 'APPROVED' next to the name of the person that requires approval. All persons listed on the document need to do so before the MIR CR is formally approved and teams can proceed to the next step of actual execution.
        12. Execution requires signing of at least 5 of 7 Genesis keys. IOG has 3 keys, CF has 2 keys, and Emurgo has 2 keys. Approving entities should clearly identify which mode of execution is going to be endorsed by each of the participating entities - direct co-signing or via delegation.
        13. The general process is as follows: IO creates the tx using special scripts to add a repository, IO creates the MIR txbody, IO sends the MIR txbody to Emurgo/CF, CF/Emurgo witness and send a witness file back to IO, IO assembles all witnesses, adds own IO keys, and submits to the blockchain.
        14. Every relevant transaction ID is to be shared/noted immediately upon execution with all key stakeholders and saved for auditing purposes. These notifications are outlined/stipulated in the MIR CR directly for each of the participating entities."

Objective is to create a one stop shop for people information","Considering the ongoing efforts to recover misallocated funds and the upcoming Catalyst Adoption project, what are the key responsibilities of the project owner, Kriss Baird, and the current status of their tasks?","Kriss Baird, as the project owner, has several key responsibilities related to the ongoing efforts to recover misallocated funds and the upcoming Catalyst Adoption project. For the misallocated funds, Kriss is working to confirm venues, dates, and quotations for upfront costs for the Barcelona accommodations ticket. Additionally, Kriss is tasked with creating a PTO handover document by March 22, 2024. For the Catalyst Adoption project, Kriss is responsible for syncing with Annie Hemmesch to share CWG key messages by March 28, 2024. Additionally, Kriss is working on Catalyst ecosystem mapping with Sam Field and John Sheffield. The current status of these tasks is not explicitly stated in the context, but it is mentioned that there have been emails sent to project owners and other social media avenues leveraged to stir attention, although there has been no activity yet. The destination wallet for the misallocated funds remains untouched, and the team continues attempts to connect through various sources for continued recovery."

Catalyst Voices
Milestone 2
Milestone 2 change request to be submitted by end of week to clarify: approach to define new CIP, deploy Catalyst Voices UI, and update delivery timelines
Two foundational CIPs and a CPS were proposed and merged.
RBAC design work is ongoing and on-target for a Milestone 2 delivery.
Snapshot tooling improvements to catalyst-gateway have progressed to processing block data for voting power.  Registration capture work is scheduled and this work stream is on-target for a Milestone 2 delivery
Design for Catalyst Voices UI to be deployed in M2 ready for dev in Flutter once frontend dev resource available
Future Milestones
Initial lofi designs for Team Setup completed, laying foundations for proposal collaboration UX; reviewed with engineering team, fostering alignment and uncovering requirements related to RBAC definition
Hifi designs for Campaign Builder UX in progress, to reduce manual effort and overhead for internal team by replacing Fund Parameters document and enabling non technical users to make ad hoc updates to parameters
Hermes
The single-threaded implementation of the Hermes core runtime engine is approaching completion with final PR’s now being reviewed.
The Cardano Node follower library is functionally complete and is being used by the Catalyst Voices snapshot tooling improvements.
5 of 6 Hermes Runtime extensions required for Milestone 2 are in progress and approx 60% complete.
A unit test runner for allowing wasm modules to be tested as required for milestone 2 delivery is in progress and approaching completion.
Milestone 2 delivery appears on-track.

TODO
Catalyst Voices
Work is in progress to define the new CIPs required by the decentralized role based access control for Catalyst Voices. Engagement with the CIP editors and broader CIP process has kicked off. Resourcing issues for flutter developers put delivery of Milestone 2 at risk.
Hermes
Development is in progress for foundational Hermes modules, including Hashing, Cryptography, and Time utility APIs. On track for delivery of Milestone 2.","Considering the ongoing issues with figma access and the impact on M2, what specific actions are required from the budget owner to achieve a final resolution?","The budget owner is required to provide input and participate in achieving a final resolution for the figma access issues impacting M2. The specific actions required from the budget owner are not explicitly stated in the context, but it can be inferred that their involvement is necessary for the IT ticket resolution to be completed and for the M2 tasks to be upskilled with flutter and delivered as required."

Define Team
Create Team
Approve Team
Manage Team
Initial target users are existing Cardano holders - catering to ‘crypto unaware out of scope for MVP’
Collaborator discovery will be based on existing registered proposers - need to consider on chain metadata included with proposer registration that can be searched by others eg nickname, ada handle, skills, etc.
consider addtl on ramps to collaboration - “apply to collaborate”; “keep proposal private, but share with my ‘friends’”
ACTIONS:
DEFINE proposer profile metadata
DESIGN view proposer profile
DESIGN request to collaborate from public proposal view
DESIGN invite to collaborate from private proposal editor view
DESIGN private to me, private to team, private to network, public
DESIGN team registration confirmation details (wallet popup)
DESIGN copy proposal to to new space
DEFINE flow for temporary teams editing
DEFINE time boxed ‘team registration cleanup’
Mainnet Registrations
40min
Frequency of new registrations required by team management
Time from tx submitted to permissions granted
Wallet signature vs Catalyst Account signature
may have ‘partial team’ when only subset of members have approved; each partial team gets new access keys - can start editing proposal with each group - then transfer edits into updated team space as new members join
FEATURE: copy proposal details across spaces, either from personal > team OR team > team - make it seamlessly to switch from solo to collab, and reduce friction between team updates
permissions may be granted immediately upon publishing - we can store temp access based on tx details in backend before we observe the registration on chain to finalize it
for admin in MVP, consider approach to use API key rather than on chain registration to simplify - reduce dev effort while maintaining security and traceability

DECIDED","How should the user experience for team setup be designed, considering factors such as defining proposer profile metadata, designing views and requests for collaboration, and managing team registration and permissions for mainnet registrations?","The user experience for team setup should be designed with the following considerations:

        * Define proposer profile metadata: The metadata should include information such as nickname, ADA handle, skills, and other relevant details that can be searched by others for collaboration.
        * Design view proposer profile: The proposer profile should be designed to provide a clear and concise view of the proposer's information, including their ADA handle, skills, and other relevant details.
        * Design request to collaborate from public proposal view: Users should be able to request to collaborate on a proposal directly from the public proposal view. This request should be sent to the proposer and any existing team members.
        * Design invite to collaborate from private proposal editor view: Users should also be able to invite others to collaborate on a proposal from the private proposal editor view. This invite should allow the recipient to join the team and access the proposal.
        * Design private to me, private to team, private to network, public: Users should have the ability to set the privacy level of their proposal to one of four options: private to me, private to team, private to network, or public.
        * Design team registration confirmation details (wallet popup): When a user registers a team, they should be presented with a wallet popup to confirm the registration details.
        * Design copy proposal to new space: Users should be able to easily copy their proposal to a new space, either from their personal space to a team space or from one team space to another.
        * Define flow for temporary teams editing: There should be a defined flow for temporary teams editing a proposal, including how to handle situations where only a subset of team members have approved the proposal.
        * Define time boxed ‘team registration cleanup’: There should be a defined time frame for cleaning up team registrations that are no longer active.
        * Frequency of new registrations required by team management: Team management should determine the frequency of new registrations required for their team.
        * Time from tx submitted to permissions granted: The time from when a transaction is submitted to when permissions are granted should be minimized to improve the user experience.
        * Wallet signature vs Catalyst Account signature: The user should have the option to use either their wallet signature or their Catalyst Account signature to grant permissions.
        * Copy proposal details across spaces: Users should be able to easily copy proposal details across spaces, either from their personal space to a team space or from one team space to another.
        * Permissions may be granted immediately upon publishing: Permissions may be granted immediately upon publishing to reduce friction between team updates.
        * For admin in MVP, consider approach to use API key rather than on chain registration: To simplify the development process and maintain security and traceability, the admin in MVP should consider using an API key rather than on chain registration.

        The initial target users for team setup are existing Cardano holders, and collaborator discovery will be based on existing registered proposers. Additional on-ramps to collaboration should be considered, such as an ""apply to collaborate"" feature or the ability to share a proposal with a user's ""friends."""

Grants Report","How can the development of the Catalyst Impact Report, including its objectives and goals, contribute to demonstrating the impact and improvements Catalyst makes to the Cardano Community and the wider blockchain ecosystem, while holding Catalyst accountable to the community and stakeholders?","The development of the Catalyst Impact Report, with its objectives and goals, can contribute to demonstrating the impact and improvements Catalyst makes to the Cardano Community and the wider blockchain ecosystem, while holding Catalyst accountable to the community and stakeholders, in several ways. Firstly, the report aims to demonstrate the decentralized ecosystem in action of Cardano builders, including a heat map by industry, location, size of team, evidence, and what problem it solves. This will showcase the tangible outcomes of Catalyst's efforts in supporting the development of the Cardano ecosystem.
        
        Secondly, the report will demonstrate the accomplishments and robustness of the Catalyst Voting System, which is a critical component of the Catalyst ecosystem. By highlighting the successes and strengths of the voting system, the report will build trust and credibility with supporters, funders, IO policy makers, and beneficiaries.
        
        Thirdly, the report will demonstrate the potential for Catalyst as an Innovation Management leader, elevating the shining stars in the ecosystem, including CWG, ambassadors, human capital that participate actively, and funded projects. This will position Catalyst as thought leaders and a commercial solution/Innovation & Treasury Management tool for other incubators.
        
        Lastly, the report will review Catalyst impact and outcomes against its vision and goals, motivating staff, proposers, and the community through celebrating achievements. The report will also share lessons with similar organizations, further solidifying Catalyst's position as a necessary organization and a leader in the blockchain ecosystem.
        
        Overall, the development of the Catalyst Impact Report, with its objectives and goals, will provide a comprehensive and data-driven demonstration of the impact and improvements Catalyst has made to the Cardano Community and the wider blockchain ecosystem, while holding Catalyst accountable to the community and stakeholders."
"Catalyst Partnerships is home to all active collaborative endeavors undertaken by the Catalyst Team with external partners with aligned synergies to move different parts of the Catalyst structure to an improved and optimized outcome.
The first of these collaborative endeavors is our recent alignment with NODO Africa, a subsidiary of Emurgo Africa – more insights below:
What is NODO?
NODO is a pan-African WEB3 discovery and news platform with a vision to inform and educate consumers on the latest Web3 products and services being developed across the African continent, powered by Emurgo.
https://nodo.xyz/
Overview of Collaboration
NODO has sent in a
proposal
focusing on three main areas:
content and PR visibility support
community building
grants facilitation in Africa
NODO aims to elevate Catalyst's visibility through content creation, foster community engagement, and facilitate grants for African WEB3 projects.
They offer services such as marketing support, educational workshops, access to a vast network (projects,VCs and other partners), operational assistance in proposal submission for first-timers from the African region, and project onboarding.
Catalyst can leverage NODO's extensive network, marketing resources and community engagement, and established presence in Africa to enhance its reach, engagement, and impact within the continent's blockchain ecosystem.
Objectives for Catalyst
Catalyst aims to leverage this collaboration with NODO to increase impact and visibility in the African region, and gain new community stakeholders participating in the Catalyst process in the following areas:
Fund 12 kick-off events
Working groups
focused on the in-person, and online WGs in the region (Nairobi, Accra, Lagos, etc)
Amplify opportunity for more Africans
Impact - With worsening economic conditions around the world and especially in the region, getting more people to participate in Catalyst community incentivized roles can change lives in real-time
Impact of African-funded and completed projects
Catalyst Network
Elevating the profile of monthly events and a strong pipeline of guests from NODO ecosystem,

Timeline
The current timeline of proposed action plans to start in the first week of April.
Working with partners to achieve a more insightful timeline document highlighting work to be done and when it will be completed, all updates will be posted here as work progresses.","How can Catalyst leverage NODO's services, such as marketing support and educational workshops, to increase its impact and visibility in the African region and gain new community stakeholders participating in the Catalyst process?","Catalyst can leverage NODO's marketing support by promoting Catalyst partners in Africa, the Africa Catalyst Townhall, and FUND onboarded projects on NODO. Joint AMAs and/or major social media campaigns can also be conducted to increase visibility. NODO's extensive network, marketing resources, and community engagement can be leveraged to enhance Catalyst's reach, engagement, and impact within the continent's blockchain ecosystem.
        
        In terms of educational workshops, Catalyst can organize accelerator workshops with NODO, delivered by industry experts, to provide intensive pitch practice for African projects onboarded through Catalyst. A demo day can also be organized to show the results of Catalyst project onboarding and promote these projects to investors and further funds/family offices looking to invest in Catalyst projects.
        
        Additionally, Catalyst can leverage NODO's community building services by creating a campaign plan and proposal for the Catalyst Community Voting & Community Contributor Campaign. This can include designing the user flow, managing the campaign timeline, and promoting the campaign through social media and other channels.
        
        Overall, by leveraging NODO's services, Catalyst can increase its impact and visibility in the African region, gain new community stakeholders participating in the Catalyst process, and promote the success of African-funded and completed projects."

"Grantees (Funded Projects)
Grantees refer to projects that are approved by the community vote to receive funding. There are two types of payments related to funding projects. Test transactions and tranche payments.
All funded projects need to validate their existing wallet addresses in order to mitigate risk of deposits to incorrect addresses.
Test transactions are required to confirm Funded Projects have an up to date access to the wallets where they will receive ADA payments.
Test transaction equals to 1 ADA per wallet.
Funded Projects are not funded in a single lump-sum payment but according to their delivery plan. All newly Funded Projects are eligible to receive only the first/initial tranche payment to begin their work on the scope of their deliverables.
Statement of Milestones (SoM) was Introduced in Fund9 codifying each funded-project’s deliverables into a standardized format. From Fund10, payment files are generated from the Milestones Module and correspond approval process that triggers release of payment.
Generally, Funded Projects receive monthly tranche payments based on the delivery schedule over the period of time stipulated in their proposals, instead of one lump sum payment, or within their SoM.
Ecosystem Supporting Roles
Project Catalyst is a complex organic ecosystem of many interdependent parts between core IOG Catalyst Team and the rest of the Cardano ecosystem. In fact, community engagement is a crucial component in ensuring sustainable and engaged participation from Cardano community members. Fair and timely compensation and incentives are paramount in that regard of maintaining a healthy agency and balanced ecosystem. The frequency of payment depends on the role and time at which funding occurs.
Monthly cadence [regular]
Ad hoc cadence [irregular]
Challenge teams are community-stewards that have supported the Catalyst team to facilitate regular-onboarding and (new to Catalyst) review of milestones
Regular Participation via three key deliverables: Introduction of Challenges, Onboarding of Funded Projects, and Return on Intention (ROI) retrospectives.
This role is in process of deprecating - in Fund10 and Fund11 the scope of work was reduced.
Community Reviewers (CRs) are community members that complete assessments of requests for funding proposals submitted to Catalyst.
CRs score proposals and this helps to deliver a ranked-order and inform voters about the subjective quality and feasibility of the submissions.
CRs are rewarded ada for assessments that meet Catalyst conditions and quality thresholds.
Voters
Voters are Project Catalyst’s major stakeholders.
They vote on which proposals should receive funding.
Only active Voters who have cast at least one vote are eligible for voter rewards.
There may be additional considerations how this role is rewarded.
This community function is responsible for coordinating and acquiring proof of life verification of all grantees with a recorded video.
Referrers are community-members who have been nominated by successful funded-projects as the individual who motivated them to submit a proposal.
Referrers receive a share of ada divided between all the eligible referrers in a given fund.

"Incoming Transfer Types
Catalyst ‘Treasury Account’ is a regular Cardano wallet operated by the custodian entity, currently by IOG Treasury Team.
This wallet is required to be topped up periodically through the execution of Change Requests (CRs) that trigger Move Instantaneous Rewards (MIR) transfers from the Cardano Treasury.
Requirement enables the Catalyst team then to execute day-to-day operations without interruptions and delays.
MIR Transfers require participation from the majority of Genesis key holders and appropriate planning and forecasting.
MIR transfers can be submitted to the blockchain only during the first 48 hours of every epoch as per ledger rules.
Epoch calendar
(community source).
This type of transfer is done between Catalyst wallets and it enables to execute transfer that operational hot wallet then disburses payments to all the community wallet accounts.
Operational wallet account may retain balance which if undistributed is then sent back to hot wallet. Operational wallet maintains low balance approximately in amount of XXX.
Projects request to refund/return already distributed funds back to the Project Catalyst.
There are cases where Funded Projects cannot complete/start execution on the scope of their deliverables.
Further, some projects wish to refund treasury payments given their success as a means of appreciation to the community efforts (paying back).
When payments are made in error and counter party makes transfer back to correct the balance.","Which wallet types and processes are involved in transferring funds from the Cardano Treasury to community wallets, and what are the requirements and restrictions for these transfers?","The wallet types involved in transferring funds from the Cardano Treasury to community wallets are the Catalyst 'Treasury Account' and the operational hot wallet.

"Once Change Requests (CRs) are fully approved (secured by both first and second-level approvals) - these are used as an authorization for the Operations Lead to request funding amount to be transferred from the Catalyst Treasury Account to the Catalyst Seed Account.
The Custodian must not transfer any amount other than designated in the approved CR document.
The Custodian must be notified in advance of the availability of incoming transfer requests via appropriate channels.
Execution of payments must follow CR-associated documentation as approved. This means every funding file is used as an audit element to account for every transfer.
Once CR transfers are executed, any excess amount is sent back to the Catalyst Treasury Account.
Catalyst Seed Account cannot have more than 1,000 ada at any non-operational time. Funding should be kept in a hot wallet only for any time that is necessary to execute and transfer amounts.
