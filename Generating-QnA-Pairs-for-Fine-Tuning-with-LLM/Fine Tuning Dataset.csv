Outcome
Summarize the outcome.","""Given the budget variance and projected costs, how will the new forecasted budget for the upcoming years impact the current spending?""","The new forecasted budget for the upcoming years will increase the current spending due to the budget variance and projected costs. The budget variance is the difference between the actual spend to date and the budget allocated, which is currently negative. The projected costs are also higher than the budget allocated, further increasing the spending. The new forecasted budget attempts to account for these increases, but it is unclear by how much without referring to the linked projection costs spreadsheet. It is also unclear whether this request can be managed within the remaining budget. Therefore, the impact on current spending is likely to be significant, but the exact amount cannot be determined without additional information."

Here are the KPIs and their significance:

        1. **Project Status**: This KPI indicates the current state of each project, such as 'On Track', 'At Risk', or 'Off Track'. It helps stakeholders quickly understand the overall health of the project portfolio.

        2. **Start and End Dates**: The start and end dates for each project are visualized, providing a clear timeline for project delivery. Any delays or changes to these dates can be easily identified and addressed.

        3. **Progress Bars**: Progress bars show the completion status of each project. They reveal the percentage of work completed and the amount of work remaining, helping stakeholders assess the project's progress.

        4. **Planned vs. Actual**: This KPI compares the planned timeline with the actual progress of each project. Any discrepancies can indicate potential issues or delays, prompting further investigation.

        5. **Resource Allocation**: The dashboard may also visualize how resources are allocated across projects. This can help stakeholders identify any imbalances or bottlenecks and make necessary adjustments.

        6. **Risks and Issues**: The dashboard might include a section for visualizing risks and issues associated with each project. This can help stakeholders anticipate and mitigate potential problems.

        7. **Budget vs. Spend**: This KPI compares the planned budget with the actual spending for each project. It can reveal any cost overruns or underspends, helping stakeholders manage project finances effectively.

        These KPIs, when viewed together in the Portfolio Roadmap dashboard, provide a comprehensive view of the project's progress, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and take timely actions."

"Our 2023 objectives contained some incredibly ambitious stretch goals. We were able to deliver most of the core objectives, largely down to our collective hard work, but also down to the quarterly planning and review rhythm and structure that we’re now operating within.
Let’s take a look at the 2023 objectives:
Objective 1 - Execute the Cardano Transition
Focus our ongoing work under four key goals:
Consent
- hold and win the vote to ratify the era of Voltaire Governance.
Consistency
- to build an independent development engine capable of ensuring the same high levels of performance.
Clarity
- ensuring at all time throughout the transition that the whole Cardano community understands where we are going and how they contribute.
Decentralization
- achieve a new level of decentralization, making Cardano the most decentralized blockchain according to the EDI Index.

"Launch Current Portfolio Into Ventures
In 2024, we will continue to launch the current portfolio (Portfolio Zero) into fully fledged ventures through a gated and supported spinout process. As a venture moves through each of these phases, they develop in each of the areas seen below.
As companies move from left to right, our commercial horizon will change. Firstly, some of the ideas we may have thought were the best ideas in the entire world, turn out not to be, so we shut them down. On the other hand, we might realize some initiatives are very similar to others, so we merge them together.
Sometimes it’s not about making money - it’s about securing or protecting something. Or, if it's a core piece of infrastructure we’ll open source it.
Other times, we make linear progress. When an idea is ‘fully realized’ and it’s self-sustaining, we've left behind an institution unto itself.
Every now and then, something will move back from right to left if we discover new information, or we realize that our business hypothesis isn't true.
It's a dynamic, creative, and flowing process, but it creates a lot of value as you start moving towards step 5. There's a huge multiple of value creation because you have real customers, real commercial models, liquidity, external investors, and a really good product market fit.
We’ll always be thinking about our portfolio alignment. These aren't just independent siloed ideas - they're part of a larger web, and if we get our web just right, we make money for each other.
Attract Investment
We’re in a privileged position where we can be particular on who we invest with; and we’re prioritizing smart capital from strategic investors from different sources to diversify participation.
We’ve invested in additional talent to support this objective, who will focus on expanding our investment network and raise awareness of our portfolio companies through strategic marketing intelligence. They’ll ensure we align our investment pitches with the new IOG corporate strategy.
Pilot Venture Governance and Servicing Approach
As ventures make their way through the process, we’ll always be learning, improving, and refining things. This will be the foundation to inform the design for our venture studio with a web3 focus. The definition of our long term relationships with web3-launched-ventures will be central to this sub objective, as well as taking an integrated approach to portfolio management.",How does the gated and supported spinout process for launching the current portfolio into fully fledged ventures contribute to the creation of value and alignment of the portfolio companies as a larger web?,"The gated and supported spinout process for launching the current portfolio into fully fledged ventures contributes to the creation of value and alignment of the portfolio companies as a larger web by providing a dynamic, creative, and flowing process that moves companies from left to right, starting with initial ideas and progressing towards fully realized, self-sustaining institutions. This process involves making strategic decisions such as shutting down non-viable ideas, merging similar initiatives, securing or protecting critical infrastructure, and making linear progress towards commercialization. The process also allows for companies to move back from right to left if new information or a change in business hypothesis requires it.
        As companies move towards step 5, there is a significant multiple of value creation due to real customers, commercial models, liquidity, external investors, and a strong product-market fit. The process also emphasizes the importance of portfolio alignment, with companies viewed as part of a larger web rather than independent siloed ideas.
        Additionally, the company is prioritizing smart capital from strategic investors from different sources to diversify participation and has invested in additional talent to support this objective. This talent will focus on expanding the investment network and raising awareness of portfolio companies through strategic marketing intelligence, ensuring that investment pitches align with the new IOG corporate strategy.
        The company will also pilot a venture governance and servicing approach as ventures make their way through the process, continuously learning, improving, and refining things. This will inform the design for a venture studio with a web3 focus and define long-term relationships with web3-launched-ventures, taking an integrated approach to portfolio management."
"Explore the IOG Venture Studio Design and Strategy
By focusing our future Venture Studio on web 3 - we’re leaning into our strengths. Objective one will pilot venture governance, and objective three (this objective) will build it.
It’ll be a modular IOG corporate strategy that explores different things such as mergers and acquisitions, partnerships, or even acquiring a web3 Venture Studio that's already in the market.
Ecosystem Thinking
As one of our competitive advantages, we’re building an ‘ecosystem view.’ There's a lot of siloing in this organization, so we will build an advanced collaboration model that's going to work with the customer at the center of it.
Exponential Organization
There are many different perspectives one can take to view IOG. Let’s get oriented.
This view shows us how we stage the growth of the company. This is a single functional view, and as we go through this journey we’ll develop other views on things like capability, accountability, and governance. Thinking of ourselves as an integration engine brings us together to work seamlessly as a strategic operations function.
We want to make things small so we have really agile and accountable groups, facilitated by that form and function. When we pull structures apart in the right way, they produce emergent value to each other.
Where do you go if you want to build a Venture Studio? Well, you need a hub!
About 90% of the world's venture capital and startups sit in such hubs. A hub liberates you to build a campus in a place that maximizes lifestyle. As we get deeper into the year, we'll start exploring places for the idea and protocols to be grown - kind of like our own
Bell Labs
.
It’s not a priority for this year, but we're committed to this model. Hopefully, it will inspire entire generations of people who go through it. It’ll be our legacy as an organization, and the nerve center upon which we innovate.
The New IOG Brand
In terms of the IOG brand, this year we’re prioritizing getting really clear about the identity of the company. We want to have a crystalized image of who we are, we want to consistently honor that image in all our communications (internal and external), and we want to lead every interaction with authenticity.","How does IOG's venture studio strategy aim to utilize an 'ecosystem view' and potential mergers, acquisitions, or partnerships to build a modular corporate strategy focused on web 3?","IOG's venture studio strategy aims to build a modular corporate strategy focused on web 3 by utilizing an 'ecosystem view' and potentially pursuing mergers, acquisitions, or partnerships. The 'ecosystem view' is a competitive advantage that IOG is building, which involves creating an advanced collaboration model with the customer at the center. This approach aims to break down silos within the organization and facilitate the growth of the company through a single functional view. As part of this strategy, IOG is considering the possibility of acquiring a web3 Venture Studio that is already in the market. Additionally, the venture studio will explore different things such as mergers, acquisitions, or partnerships to expand its capabilities and offerings in the web 3 space. The goal is to create a hub that will serve as a campus for the idea and protocols to be grown, similar to Bell Labs, which will inspire future generations and serve as the nerve center for innovation within the organization."
"Improve Efficiency and Effectiveness
PI planning has made big strides in 2023, and there's more wins on the way this year in terms of reducing bureaucracy, and improving overall effectiveness. We’ll also roll out the PI process to different functions, such as the President's Office.
Provide Excellent, Customized Services
The Operations team is evolving to support the spin out entities on continuous improvement and budgeting, too.
Create A Predictable and Reliable Operating System
Underpinned by performance metrics to support shared service delivery and the spin out process, we will develop and implement continuous improvement strategy for business operations. There will also be a focus on supporting quarterly executive planning with budget inputs.
Our budget process is a great example of how we’re already improving the process this year:
We’re aligning budget check-ins to quarterly deliverable cycles and PI Planning to better understand budget health through the year
Adopting a strategy led budgeting process to provide a north star to inform the resources required to support the roadmap
We’re utilizing data to tell the budget story - for example, a spin out will require a higher marketing spend when they’re ready to launch
We’re also connecting budgets to value demos to understand the actual spend and value delivered to help us make proactive decisions","How is the PI planning process being leveraged to improve efficiency and effectiveness, and what role does the Operations team play in supporting continuous improvement and budgeting for spin out entities?","The PI planning process is being leveraged to improve efficiency and effectiveness by reducing bureaucracy and improving overall effectiveness.

"There's an enormous amount of raw value that's been constructed within the Cardano ecosystem:
The DAP (decentralized app) portfolio
The sovereign wealth fund of Cardano
The network effect of the ecosystem
The brand value
And more...
We're still very committed to Cardano, and we’re repositioning ourselves to a role where we have a healthy, productive, well-managed relationship with the ecosystem. In this new relationship we’ll get to create value together, but at the same time, we get to keep doing the things that we love.
Cardano 2.0
Cardano 2.0 is our future vision of Cardano, as partners within the community. This research-focused vision is the extension of our first paper
Why Cardano
.
Our first workshop on this kicked off with the end in mind. We started with questions like:
how do we eclipse all other cryptocurrencies and become the world standard? What would a trillion dollar ecosystem look like?
This brought us back to the philosophical guts of our research agenda. It's easy to build systems that have lots of features and capabilities, but those systems do not necessarily have the same philosophical compatibility when we talk about cryptocurrencies, for example: centralization and inclusive accountability.
Therefore, the need for tenets becomes critical. As design principles and goals within the Cardano constitution in the future, tenets will help the community steer the vision.
We have this meta problem when we talk about a decentralized ecosystem - there’s no single person making decisions. The only way to deliver the Cardano vision is to write down these tenets, and make a proposal to the community for ratification.
Similar to the Bill of Rights in the US Constitution, these tenets are telling you -
a user of the system
- that certain things that you think are true, will stay true in the protocol: you're not going to have your funds locked, your transactions are not going to be blocked, and you're not going to be prevented from deploying an application. You can't be censored in that dimension.
The system will safely preserve the value and information that you decide to store in it. Meaning, you're not going to have somebody edit the blockchain because it's inconvenient to them. If we put it in the constitution, we put it into the design language, and we put it into the roadmap. Not only do we preserve these types of things, but we find a way to stay competitive.
When you widen the aperture, this will be one of the biggest differentiators between us and other web3 ecosystems. Our ecosystem wears its values on its sleeve, and we care so much about them that we're prepared to commit ourselves to long arc research agendas and product development. We've aligned our community to agree that these things are fundamental rights that matter.
IOG - The Cardano Community Member
We’re active members of the Cardano community through the Intersect Board and the Intersect Civics Committee. Together, we’re convening the constitution workshops and the ratification of the constitution.
We’re also supporting them in the development of their open-source, fit-for-purpose, product backlog process for Cardano - ensuring it’s process driven, and collaborative. In the same vein, we’ll also serve on numerous technical steering committees and working groups, including the Cardano Foundation (CF). This work shows our commitment to Cardano.
Cardano Innovation and Ecosystem Experts
As we help define and innovate the Cardano ecosystem, we refine our own ecosystem design and innovation skills. Within this objective, we’ll continue to evolve Catalyst as a critical role in the ecosystem, too.
Cardano Value Model
As we define how we participate in the Cardano ecosystem, we will identify how we give back, and also how to leverage a lot of really interesting things within the ecosystem as a value model. This would include sourcing new deals or new product ideas for our future Venture Studio.
We're also going to be securing a long-term vendor contract with the Intersect and the Dev Trust for IOI.",How will the proposed tenets in the Cardano constitution ensure the preservation and protection of user value and information within the decentralized ecosystem?,"The proposed tenets in the Cardano constitution will ensure the preservation and protection of user value and information within the decentralized ecosystem by committing to long-term research agendas and product development that prioritize decentralization and inclusive accountability. These tenets will be written down and proposed to the community for ratification, serving as design principles and goals within the Cardano constitution. They will tell users that certain things will stay true in the protocol, such as the inability to have funds locked, transactions blocked, or applications prevented from deployment. The system will safely preserve the value and information that users decide to store in it, and no one will be able to edit the blockchain because it's inconvenient for them. This commitment to values and rights will differentiate the Cardano ecosystem from other web3 ecosystems and ensure the long-term preservation and protection of user value and information."
"Review Our Employee Value Proposition
We want to grow our people and culture capabilities and create a culture first approach to everything we do. We have an amazing corporate strategy, and we believe that capturing, harnessing, and deploying our culture in a strategic way will help us drive that overarching strategy forward. In order to realize that, we first have to get really focused on employee experience, which anchors on the employee lifecycle.
Improve Retention, Sustainability, and Productivity
A big part of this objective is going to be defining and building a next level, data informed, customer-centric, employee life cycle capability. This capability will be like a center of excellence, serving as a central point of cultural coordination between the teams and capabilities that touch the employee experience.
We want to have an amazing value proposition that will help attract talent, and retain them through employee growth, engagement, and career planning and development.We’ll partner with the Talent Acquisition team to make sure we're attracting top talent that mesh as well with our culture.
Robust Internal Communication
Internal communication is a huge capability to deliver our people and culture objectives. This year you’ll see us invest in a robust internal comms layer that prioritizes transparency and cultural integration.
We’ve already made huge strides by introducing an intranet, which will continue to grow and evolve this year, with your input. Through this channel, and the evolution of our other key internal channels like our Town Hall, you’ll access timely, effective and relevant information to support you in your role.","What is the role of the proposed central point of cultural coordination in realizing the company's goal of harnessing and deploying its culture in a strategic way to improve retention, sustainability, and productivity?","The proposed central point of cultural coordination will serve as a hub for all things related to employee experience, which is a key component of the company's goal of harnessing and deploying its culture in a strategic way to improve retention, sustainability, and productivity. This central point will coordinate the efforts of various teams and capabilities that touch the employee experience, ensuring that there is a consistent and cohesive approach to culture-building. By defining and building a next level, data-informed, customer-centric, employee life cycle capability, the company will be able to attract and retain top talent, as well as support their growth, engagement, and career development. This, in turn, will lead to improved retention, sustainability, and productivity. Additionally, the company will invest in a robust internal comms layer that prioritizes transparency and cultural integration, which will further support the efforts of the central point of cultural coordination."

The result is non-aligned disconnected strategies and activities on various downstream levels due to lack of upper level information.
Examples of wrong order include: IT strategy should be ready before business strategy, OKRs and KPIs should be known before business processes are identified, or resource optimisation should be finished before financial planning. Naturally, there are much more dependencies between the deliverables than these three sample dependency chains.

Below is an illustration of the Enterprise Service Products OVS steps, with its service products and business capabilities, that delineates the process of generating and accumulating value, alongside the value proposition for each step of the value stream, and the outcomes for value exchange.
Product Development - Development Value Stream
The first four steps of the Enterprise Service Products OVS form the Product Development Development Value Stream (DVS) to produce new products and iterations to the existing products. The strength of the approach is two fold: On one hand the same DVS can produce the Enterprise Solution Delivery DVS and on the other hand, the outcome value of the value stream steps of the Product Development DVS can be offered as service products in the Enterprise Service Products OVS.
In the Product Development DVS, the value stream steps work together following the DevOps best practices, and the last two steps from development to operations can apply GitOps for continuous seamless delivery.

"Summary
In the heart of the Business Operating System is the Business Change Delivery Pipeline, a comprehensive framework designed to streamline the implementation of business changes across an organisation. It facilitates the alignment of strategic objectives with operational activities, ensuring that all levels of the company, from the executive board down to individual development teams, work towards a unified vision.
This approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also fosters innovation by integrating technology-driven initiatives critical for maintaining competitive advantage. However, the complexity of coordinating such a widespread organisational effort introduces potential risks and conflicts, necessitating robust IT systems for governance.
Introduction
Essentially, the Business Change Delivery Pipeline offers a strategic and structured approach to implementing change within an organisation. By leveraging automation and IT systems, companies can overcome potential risks and conflicts, ensuring that their strategic objectives are achieved through efficient and effective operational execution.
The Business Change Delivery Pipeline embodies a structured methodology for enacting transformation within an organisation's business model, ensuring a seamless transition from strategic planning to operational execution. This pipeline serves as the backbone of business change, guiding the flow of initiatives from the conception of strategic themes by the executive board through to their implementation by various teams within the organisation.
Managing the risk of complexity
Successful implementation of the Business Change Delivery Pipeline leads to a more agile and responsive organisation, capable of quickly adapting to market changes and internal strategic shifts that are many in the emerging technology markets. However, the complexity of managing numerous initiatives across different teams and functions can introduce risks and conflicts, particularly in terms of resource allocation and prioritisation of projects.
Implementing Business Change Delivery
Understanding the flow and the benefits
The Business Change Delivery Pipeline initiates at the strategic level, where the Executive Board articulates the business model, including the value proposition, products, and revenue streams, to provide a transparent understanding of how the enterprise operates, see the illustration below.
Unfortunately, many organisations fail at this first step by merely publishing a vague slide deck, which makes it difficult to guide the resources to contribute to their vision. It is significant the Executive Board expresses the company's strategy in an implementable manner, laying down the groundwork for operational planning and execution. This strategic direction, expressed as Strategic Themes, is then translated into actionable objectives, with funding allocated specifically to initiatives that align with the company's strategic themes, ensuring that every change contributes directly to the overarching goals of the organisation.
Funding is strategically allocated to initiatives that support and combine both operational model changes and product innovations. This framework cascades down to technology and operational planning, where enterprise architects, alongside portfolio and product managers, employ advanced working methods and automation to realise the strategic objectives. Enabler and Business Epics are identified and prioritised to form a coherent Portfolio Vision and Roadmap, guiding the development within Business Capabilities.
One of the core benefits of this approach is the creation of a transparent and coherent framework that aligns all the levels of the organisation, from portfolio managers and product managers to development teams, towards common strategic objectives. This alignment enhances efficiency, reduces redundancy, and ensures that operational changes and technology initiatives are directly contributing to the strategic competitive advantage of the company.
Step-by-Step Flow of Business Change Delivery
The business model
implements the transparent understanding how the enterprise operates, incl. value proposition, products, revenue streams, resources and processes.
The Executive Board publishes the company strategy in an implementable way to ensure a single source for ""
strategic themes
"" that are easy to align through the organisation.
Clear division
how we change our company
, i.e., the business operating system / the operating model, and our products in synergy. (Tip: In product-oriented organisations, too often operations come as an after-thought.)
""
Strategic Objectives Alignment
"" is the budgeting method where the funding is granted only to the initiatives supporting the strategic themes. (Tip: Important to avoid funding allocation based on the organisational structure rather than the business strategy and objectives.)
In technology-driven organisations or in digital transformation, technology initiatives are needed for the strategic competitive advantage and they impact greatly the financial allocations. This is the level where portfolio managers, product managers and enterprise architects operate, i.e.,
how to use advanced working methods and automation
to achieve the strategic company objectives.
The business change is implemented in Technology Enablement Epics (
Enabler Epics
) and
Business Epics
with the understanding which Enabler Epics are needed for which Business Epics made of Business Features. Together with enterprise architects, solution architects work on producing solution scenarios to build the technology initiatives.
As a combination, Enabler Epics and Business Epics form a
Portfolio Vision
, i.e.,
what should be built
, and Portfolio Roadmap, i.e.,
in which order
the Epics need to be built. (Tip: Not to be mixed up with aspirational milestones set by sales.)
The enterprise is managed as
Business Capabilities
that create the Operational Value Stream(s). Business Capabilities are as independent as possible, potentially inside domains. They may run on enterprise platforms. Solution architects work inside Business Capabilities as SMEs on specific services and/or platforms.

. All the software teams serve the Release Trains and their cadence.
The software teams are divided into three categories: Shared Services Teams, Development
Teams, and Platform Teams. Embedded technical architects help the teams in solving particular design challenges. The reponsibilities of the teams divide as follows:
In the Release Train,
Development Teams
develop Features making Epics.
In the Release Train,
Shared Services Teams
develop specialty Features and their parts together with several other teams.
Platform Teams
offer services inside Business Capabilities, such as connection to enterprise integration platform, cloud platform specific configuration, customer data platform administration, data curation, etc. To summarise, the main task of the Platform Teams is to ensure the platforms offer all the features needed by the Release Train in time.
Business Change Delivery Automation
Choosing the right automation
To mitigate the challenges stemming from the organisational complexity, the Business Change Delivery Pipeline should be supported by automation and robust IT systems, which play a crucial role in ensuring the smooth flow of information and resources throughout the pipeline. For the organisation following agile principles and methodologies at the enterprise level, focusing on adaptability, flexibility, and responsiveness to change, Enterprise Agile Planning (EAP) tools and frameworks support the essential dynamic prioritisation of initiatives. EAP fosters collaboration across teams enabling faster decision-making and implementation in line with changing market demands and strategic objectives.
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are comprehensive software platforms designed to integrate and manage all the core processes of an organisation, from finance and HR to supply chain, operations, services, and technology. ERP systems aim to streamline business processes, improve data visibility across departments, and enhance overall operational efficiency by providing a single source of truth. They are traditionally associated with more rigid, structured planning and execution methodologies, focusing on optimisation, control, and predictability.
Notably, EAP is not a software system like ERP but a strategic approach supported by various tools designed to implement agile methodologies across upscaling and large organisations. EAP is more suitable for an organisation operating in dynamic markets where the ability to quickly adapt to change is a competitive advantage. For the Business Change Delivery Pipeline, particularly in contexts emphasising innovation, technology-driven transformation, and the need for rapid implementation of strategic initiatives, EAP aligns better with these objectives. However, ERP and EAP can be complementary, with ERP providing the operational backbone and EAP guiding the strategic and agile execution of business change initiatives.
Key IT systems and the delivery tool chain
These key IT systems must not only facilitate strategic planning and operational execution but also enable robust management of innovation, financials, and targeted customer value. When selecting IT systems for these needs, it is important to prioritise integration capabilities to ensure seamless data flow and visibility across the organisation. Notably, some platforms offer multiple functionalities, reducing the need for disparate systems, different vendors, and added integration overhead.
For instance, some comprehensive Project Portfolio Management platforms include features for financial operations, cost management, and even aspects of business capability management. Similarly, advanced EAP tools offer features that support aspects of innovation management and delivery pipeline automation. By carefully selecting systems that can cover multiple requirements, the organisation can streamline the IT infrastructure, reduce complexity, and improve the effectiveness of the Business Change Delivery Pipeline.
Enterprise Agile Planning (EAP) Tool:
This tool supports agile planning and execution at scale, integrating with development tools to provide real-time visibility into progress, priorities, and resource allocation. An EAP tool enables the coordination of strategic initiatives across various teams and departments, facilitating agile methodologies throughout the organisation. (

In the budget proposal for 2024
)
Business Capability Management System:
System, often integrated inside the EAM software, designed to map, analyse, and manage business capabilities, ensuring that the organisation's operational capabilities align with strategic objectives. This system should integrate with EA and EAP tools to provide a holistic view of how capabilities support strategic initiatives. (
In the budget proposal for 2024
)
DevOps and Continuous Delivery Pipeline Tools:
Tools that automate the software development lifecycle, from code integration to deployment, supporting the rapid delivery of business change initiatives. For oversight, these tools should integrate with EAP tools to align development activities with agile planning processes on a portfolio level. (
In the budget proposal for 2024
)
Project Portfolio Management (PPM) and Financial Operations Software:
A comprehensive platform that supports the prioritisation and management of projects and initiatives based on strategic alignment and financial performance. This software should include capabilities for standardised cost management and financial monitoring, ensuring that financial allocations among epics and initiatives are effectively and fairly managed. (
In the budget proposal for 2024
)
Product and Customer Value Management Platform:
System designed to manage various product portfolios and measure customer value, integrating customer feedback and market trends into the product development lifecycle. These platforms should link with EAP and innovation management tools to ensure that product strategies align with overall business objectives and customer needs. (
In the budget proposal for 2024
)
Additionally, platforms for collaboration and communication, such as enterprise social networks, online instant messaging and meeting tools, are essential for maintaining alignment and fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation across the organisation.","How does the Business Change Delivery Pipeline align strategic objectives with operational activities to ensure all levels of an organization work towards a unified vision, and what potential risks and conflicts can arise from its implementation?","The Business Change Delivery Pipeline is a comprehensive framework designed to streamline the implementation of business changes across an organization. It aligns strategic objectives with operational activities, ensuring that all levels of the company work towards a unified vision. This approach enhances operational efficiency and fosters innovation by integrating technology-driven initiatives critical for maintaining competitive advantage. However, potential risks and conflicts can arise from its implementation due to the complexity of coordinating such a widespread organizational effort, necessitating robust IT systems for governance.

        The Business Change Delivery Pipeline initiates at the strategic level, where the Executive Board articulates the business model, including the value proposition, products, and revenue streams, to provide a transparent understanding of how the enterprise operates. This strategic direction, expressed as Strategic Themes, is then translated into actionable objectives, with funding allocated specifically to initiatives that align with the company's strategic themes, ensuring that every change contributes directly to the overarching goals of the organization.

        Funding is strategically allocated to initiatives that support and combine both operational model changes and product innovations. This framework cascades down to technology and operational planning, where enterprise architects, alongside portfolio and product managers, employ advanced working methods and automation to realize the strategic objectives. Enabler and Business Epics are identified and prioritized to form a coherent Portfolio Vision and Roadmap, guiding the development within Business Capabilities.

        One of the core benefits of this approach is the creation of a transparent and coherent framework that aligns all the levels of the organization, from portfolio managers and product managers to development teams, towards common strategic objectives. This alignment enhances efficiency, reduces redundancy, and ensures that operational changes and technology initiatives are directly contributing to the strategic competitive advantage of the company.

        However, the complexity of managing numerous initiatives across different teams and functions can introduce risks and conflicts, particularly in terms of resource allocation and prioritization of projects. Implementing robust IT systems and automation can help mitigate these challenges, ensuring the smooth flow of information and resources throughout the pipeline."

figure out the delivery team and assignee who will be driving a particular Jira ticket to its resolution:
if it is something that
can
be resolved by this triage team (usually, it is documentation, questions, clarifications, etc.), someone from the triage team gets assigned to it
If it is something that
can’t
be resolved by the triage team (usually, it is code issues), the triage team figures out to which development team the Jira ticket at hand belongs, and it gets assigned to the Delivery Lead/PM on this development team. The Delivery Lead/PM is notified and expected to drive the assigned Jira ticket to its resolution.
Also, on each comms triage call, we review the progress on all the previously triaged open tickets.
3.How We Collect Community Feedback
The users are informed to log their
tech issues
on relevant github repositories (i.e. cadano-node for node issues, plutus for plutus issues, dbsync for dbsync issues)
Also, the comms folks involved in this process check various comms channels daily (or several times a day) to capture unanswered questions, concerns, and not-tech issues. Currently, this feedback ends up on the following
comms tracking spreadsheet
managed by
Rebecca Hopwood (Unlicensed)
- going forward, we will see if we can get this feedback logged in Jira from the get-go. All the new things on the
comms tracking spreadsheet
are triaged on the next triage call and get logged in Jira.

nn/mm/24 (+2mth)","What is the current process for triaging and resolving Chang H/F community support incidents on the Cardano testnet, and how are they logged and tracked in Jira?","The current process for triaging and resolving Chang H/F community support incidents on the Cardano testnet involves an initial support triage group consisting of Engineering (Kevin Hammond) and Comms (Leonard Hegarty) who update asynchronously or in-person every workday to review all new untriaged community support incidents, set severity (impact) on Jira tickets, figure out the delivery team and assignee who will be driving a particular Jira ticket to its resolution, and review the progress on all previously triaged open tickets. Community support incidents are logged in Jira by navigating to the CHANG COMMUNITY BOARD Jira board, clicking on the “Create” button, and filling in/selecting the following fields: Issue type (Bug), Summary (title of the incident), Labels (Community_Bugs), Incident Source (source where the incident comes from), Incident Type (if it is clear what type), Description (description of the incident), and Severity (Impact) Cardano H/F (Sev-1 Major, Sev-2 Severe, Sev-3 Moderate, Sev-4 Minor, or Sev-5 Trivial). Jira dropdown fields to be filled in/selected on community incident Jira tickets include Labels (Community_Bugs), Incident Type (Documentation, Code Issue, Code Enhancement, Question, FUD), Incident Source (Discord, Github, Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, IOG Slack, Direct Calls/Messages/Emails), Severity (Impact) Cardano H/F (Sev-1 Major, Sev-2 Severe, Sev-3 Moderate, Sev-4 Minor, or Sev-5 Trivial), Delivery Team (the team assigned to resolve/handle incidents), and Actions (Discussion with Charles Morgan on Governance keys, Gather downstream PMs/POs to confirm readiness for Chang HF, etc.)."
